/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<pre>Story dragged, and the cast wasn&#39;t believable in too many roles. I was especially disappointed in Angelina.
It sucked! Way too drawn out. Eternals seemed like the length of the movie!
Movie was drawn out, Not as much action as the trailer made it seem. Kept going from pst to present and it got a little confusing. Just not as good as I thought it would be. Son loves Marvel movies and he said it was Meh!.
Excellent Marvel cinematography! However because there are so many characters to introduce in a short amount of time, you aren&#39;t able to properly build attachments to the characters the way by the time the movies climax would expect you to.
Most people in the comments are confused and unsatisfied because their ignorance serves them well.
Was great, dont understand the hate for it at all. Film introduces whats basically a whole separate universe into the current Marvel canon, and does it fairly well. The action was pretty great, as was the overall story. I havent enjoyed Marvel films recently as their quality has severely dropped ever since the release of Infinity War. This film, however, stands on its own and manages to do quite a lot with its runtime.
Honestly for all the hype I thought I would love it as I love the Avenger series of Marvel Movies. However, there are too many characters and you don&#39;t really get to know them to feel a connection with them. To me, the movie lacks emotional connection.
Maybe they shouldve committed to like part 1 and part 3
it&#39;s shit. boring and horrible story. too bored to explain more. don&#39;t watch this. it&#39;s dumb.
Excellent. Dont forget the two post credits at the End 🤓
I&#39;m not the biggest Marvel fan, but this movie took the cake. It had to be one of the best movies I have seen in recent years, and the music was compelling and beautiful. Everything worked well to tell this story, and this all-star cast stole the show. Some people and other movie critics have reviewed that the back and forth in time events confused them, but then these same people can&#39;t balance a damn checkbook, and nothing makes them happy! The movie was fantastic, and Gemma Chan and Richard Manning even pulled tears from this Marine&#39;s eyes during the &#34;Emergence&#34; scene, which was fantastic! I give this movie a total of a 10+. I have seen it alone, and with friends a total of 5 times now. That&#39;s what Marvel fans do, right? I can&#39;t wait to see the second one at a future date....Go see it and understand this is not a fast action packed film, but one about humanity and love. The underwritten humor between the characters was spot on, especially with Phastos and Kingo! Great work. I will enjoy this movie for years to come. Thank you for the experience.
disappointing for a long time Marvel and scifi fan. with budget this big and these good actors, this movie should have been so much better. loses me with how slow it is. maybe a different director could have taken this same story and knocked it out of the park. I will give it a second chance when it comes to Disney plus.
Honestly the most boring movie i think i have ever seen i almost feel asleep more times than i could count i found myself relieved when i had to use the restroom so I could have a break for a few minutes before having to sit through another horrendous hour of this movie. It wasn’t even horrible it just so freaking boring It would have been more entertaining watch golf on the big screen for 3 hours.
great story and a diversity in cast.
Really good movie. A little slow developing but action scenes was very well done and movie ended better than it started
I LOVED this movie!!! I tried to described it to others by refering to it as &#34;..a SF soap opera!&#34; It was so involved and I never expected how it carried on. I had to take other friends to see it. And I loved it even more the second time. I understood so much more and caught so many more things. Can&#39;t wait for the sequel!!!
Absolutely amazing!!! Definitely recommend!!!
Really was expecting more action not the worst movie but could have waited til it was free to watch
I don’t believe that a marvel “kid” movie should have two homosexual men shown as a family with a child. That’s not natural and children shouldn’t see that.
entertaining as always
This movie had so much potential with a star studded cast but the dialogue was incredibly cheesy and the plot line was all over the place. Its good to watch with youre an MCU fan just for knowledge but I wouldnt pay for it
Liked the action. Big surprise ending
Wow. Just an awful movie. The plot never made sense and it felt like they were so busy focusing on how to shove as much diversity into the movie to even worry about a cohesive storyline. Character development was awful. Avoid at all costs!
We walked out after a grueling hour. Maybe little kids will like this movie. But, as an adult fan of the MCU, I was embarrassed for all the big name actors who were suckered into making fools of themselves in this film.
It didnt have the WOW factor of the other Marvel movies, probably one of the few. Hopefully in the future they can give us more.
Honestly, this movie may get better in time but as a stand alone in the MCU universe, it wasn’t a fun watch. The storyline was all over the place and somehow, despite the movie running 45 minutes longer than it needed to, it felt completely rushed and under developed. Won’t watch this one again until more surrounding one off movies support the eternals story line
Better than what critics say
I liked how diverse the characters were mainly. It seemed very intentional. The story of blind loyalty only to be awaken is always a good storyline.
Marvel is trying too hard to include everyone.
I loved the plot sequence, picture, and the actions was epic. Definitely one of my favorite marvel movies this year.
The only thing good about this movie is the special effects, everything else was dragged out way too long without much importance to the viewer so the entertainment factor was adversely impacted. One of the worse marvel films. The ink saving grace was Gemma Chan.
I liked EVERY PART of the movie! I mean it&#39;s part of the MCU...DUH! -)
Amazing! Starfox and black night!!!
Really good movie, highly recommend!
Eternals was ruined the same way Spiderman 3 was and Iron Man 3 nearly was. A 2.5 hour long touchy feely drama fest with hardly any action. For as powerful as they were supposed to be, they sure did die rather easily.
the acting was so bad and you could see their mouths didnt match the voiceover of other languages on the actors. small details were messed up like how in one shot someone would turn their head left and then it zooms out and its straight. plot and details were fuzzy and felt like a forced marvel movie with no real point. worse than venom 2.
It was a mediocre Marvel movie. The plot got jumbled about half way through but you could make sense as you went. The plot twist was amazing and the end credit scenes need more explaining.
less action filled, but great movie.
I enjoyed it as a stand-alone movie. Character development was necessarily abrupt because of the large cast. But it was fun to watch. My biggest gripe is that it doesn&#39;t feel like it fits in the MCU. The events that transpired were epic enough that it doesn&#39;t make sense to not have an appearance of any of the known defenders of the planet.
Excellent film. Tremendous addition to the MCU.
I liked the way they were not invincleble, but worked together to keep this planet alive.
Classical Marvel Magic, a must see ti any fan of the Marvel Universe!!
lots of action but the story was dragged on too long, it could have been an hour and a half or forty five minute movie. it was unnecessarily long
If you understand history, the layered puns are impeccable. Once again Marvel makes a jab that goes clean over the audiences heads. Great spin for the universe.
Need more in-depth introduction to each characters!!
Poor story line. Time line jumping was annoying and did not make the story better.
Hard a hard time following the plot…. Probably just me.
Didn&#39;t care for it, similar quality of story to Iron Man 3, which is not a compliment. Still the movie wasn&#39;t bad nor was it good but helped the story proceed along the MCU. The fights were okay, but the story was mediocre. all in all 6/10
Very good story. nice addition to the Marvel Universe 😄
Its long so be ready to settle in - but much better than many of these negative reviews.
Good long movie that was deep with meaning and action!
Great movie, great theatre. Boomers will come unglued if you dont sit in your assigned seat. Otherwise, great night.
I see what they were trying to do with this movie but it wasn&#39;t enough to make it entertaining.
this was a good movie with great stories and character reveals, but probably should&#39;ve been another hour longer, as it was clear that scenes were sliced up, as certain plot points would be explained later in the film (and to their credit, they were). these cuts were made to fit the film in a standard time frame, but came at the cost of flow. that said, the events, visuals, and reveals of the movie mostly make up for the at-times chopy flow flow, anticlimactic ending, and awkward, unnecessary sex scene
I&#39;m a big Marvel fan. Was not into this movie at all.
The ending was awesome!
It seemed under developed. The plot was decent but could have used more action.
This movie felt like a breath of fresh air in the super hero genre. Eternals was full of beautiful shots and a wonderful diverse cast.
Very impressive FX and GCI, good story, decent acting. None of it FANTASTIC, but all of it very good to excellent. It leaves a lot of unanswered questions and opens some interesting doors for future movies.
Its a bit slower pace than other MCU movies and the story was okay. I think the incredible cast was a bit underutilized. There are some good laughs thanks to a small role but he is a welcome breakout star. I wouldve streamed it vs going to the theater but wanted to watch this before I went to see the new spider man.
It was great. Loved all the characters while laughing and crying with them.
to much drama and disingenuous character development it tried to create twists in the plot but I felt it just made it feel like a con.
I like the characters and the story line. I realize this is what I would call a foundation movie but the action was a little lacking. Just a little.
Marvel movies are all entertaining but this felt like a low effort churned out product by the Disney machine. There was little to no plot or character development. Mild humor with no standout moments. It felt like the point of the movie was to be inclusive to every type of person, which is admirable, but isn&#39;t really a driving force or storyline.
Boring. Too long. Disjointed.
it was all over the place not good at all
Definitely more of a cerebral or thinking type movie. Even though I did enjoy it, at times it seemed to drag &amp; I think it would have been better to cut it down by 15-20 minutes. The Eternals are a lesser known comic book franchise ( compared to the Avengers), so I&#39;m thinking the director or someone wanted to give more back story to make up for that.
Marvel does it again.
I loved the backgrounds and the life history and action of the series
Greatly entertaining and action packed. Not sure why people are giving the film such a hard time.
Definitely more of a cerebral movie than an action movie. Character development is great for all new line up. Powerful acting makes me care for all of them. More Eternals, please.
weak great fx. nothing else
action was good keep u interested and quite of bit of history involed
I thought it was really good. They streamlined a very long and convoluted story line in a way that still represented the major themes and characters. There&#39;s also a ton of easter eggs throughout the movie for marvel fans
It was full of action and kept me on my seat and wondering what would happen next
Never could get emotional invested in this movie. Weird GOT tie ins. End credit scene was best part of the movie.
Explains what the Celestial’s are capable of when it comes to cosmic rays, and world extinction. But over all Harry Styles debuting as Brother of Thanos gave me the spect of what the future Marvel Cinematic Universe will look like with the next Eternals Movie
Good character development, though some characters neededbackstop. story.
Gave goosebumps and never got boring!
The action/fighting scenes were good. The story line was not. It Bounced around too much, too many complexities, and did not tie together well.
The characters didnt have much chemistry. The guy in the sky was weird
Great movie! Can&#39;t wait to see what comes next for the Eternals.
We left in the middle of the movie
Slow moving and was just a prequel for future films. Very disappointed.
I thought it was a good movie.
Fantastic! Loved everything about it! Surprisingly very funny! Excellent storyline, fantastic action scenes, beautiful costumes, special effects, easy to follow, characters were very well done! it got you thinking! Loved all the laser action and especially liked how they linked the entire movie to real historical artifacts at the end in the credits section!
Like always, Marvel has dropped another gem. The Eternals! You will enjoy this must see movie.
Story was fine, but too long.
Great movie. Can’t wait to see the next one
Extremely bad movie without any story.
Really good and can&#39;t wait for the next one
It was good but not as much as the other Marvel movies..
It was okay, honestly my favorite part was the last 15 minutes
Lots of action and explanation of the greater marvel universe… pretty funny as well.
I thought I was watching a marvel movie not the notebook
I was so disappointed on this movie. I usual love marvel movies. I went to sleep and I never go to sleep in movie. it took to long to get to the action. I didn&#39;t like the man on man action. The graphics was great the quality good.I just didn&#39;t like the film. it pains me to say this. Me and kids are die hard fans of the band
Left in the middle of the movie totally sucked
yeah I&#39;m going to pass on this one the film wasn&#39;t great and the whole plot didn&#39;t make any sense rather want Celestial is removed from the Marvel cinematic Universe
Worst Marvel movie to date. Many plot holes , a lot the movie doesn’t make any sense. A lot of it feels forced. It was boring. I was really disappointed and just sad , really sad
Love the new story line this marvel movie opens up.
good story, curious to see more
The storyline was good and now it has left us with the opening of a continuation of Eternals to tell another story and bring into other characters for the Eternals 2.
Movie was really boring. We walked out about 3/4 through. A waste of time.
I liked the flip at the climax. When you see the scene where it happens, youll understand.
Liked the movie but felt it jumped around too much.
Beginning was good but then the thrill is gona, gets to be boring.
Long, rambling, and nonsensical at times. Tried to be political without seeming so. Did love the diversity tho!
We loved this movie. Worth watching.
I hope I never have to see another Eternal movie again. Lame storytelling if you could even call it a story. I wanted to like it since Im a big marvel fan but It was beyond stupid. My husband fell asleep
This movie had a lot of representation and that was awesome! I was very happy to hear about a character speaking ASL in the marvel universe. That being said this movie was painful to watch, it felt almost eternal..
interesting concept but should have been developed better and faster. I think I enjoyed the character lineup more then anything. Yes it needs work but compared to Black Widow and Shang-Ra-La or whatever that Chinese version of a Marvel movie was suppose to be I would rather watch The Eternals over 10 times. I guess I am just a big fan of whatever Gemma Chan does I could look at her for an eternity and never get bored. Jolie also did step up to the plate this time.
Love it, Marvel never disappoints
new heros, new universe. win,win.
Liked the special effects, but the movie moved slowly in developing its purpose. Of course, this is an introduction to the Eternals, so characters the love in which they exist had to be developed. Good introduction
First hour was too slow. It took a while, even with the flashbacks, to figure out what was going on. Good special effects and much needed humor. A bit too sappy at times.
It was a good marvel movie
Had so much potential but the storyline was underwhelming at best.
Great film. Very well done directed. Wishes it synthesized more with the other MCU films/shows.
it was slow and it was wack. The strongest eternal couldn&#39;t even beat the wrakest D.C. character.
Great story telling. Beautiful, philosophical and complicated. A bit long but well worth watching. Really makes you think about true purpose and fits nicely into the Marvel universe.
Man, very different Marvel movie from what I&#39;m used to seeing. Great story, action, and the jokes were spot on. I will watch this again on Disney Plus!
I loved the cinematic excellence of the movie that made it fun to watch on the big screen. The thing I disliked was is it was so long.
family really loved this movie. perfect? no. but still a really good entertaining movie!!
Outstanding character development within a big budget superhero action extravaganza
Hiccups in the story line, the last scenes brings dissatisfaction, it’s sort of mediocre action based on they should or propose to be more powerful than the avengers. Being that it’s an obvious part 2 as the marvel sequences never end, it could be a lot better explanation of the story.
Not good. Couldn’t stay for the last hour!
Not one of Marvels best. Slow, plodding storyline. At times rather confusing. Who are all these characters? Marvel acts like we should be familiar with them. Most of us are not. Too many of them to really develop well. Did enjoy the special effects and battle scenes. Lots of power cosmic being thrown around. Some very interesting main characters did stand out in various scenes, but still got bogged down in the confusing storyline. Marvel needed to trim out 30 minutes. Will be interesting if Marvel continues using the characters for future films.
Everything was perfect, good story line
It was okay. Decent story although a bit more creative license deviation from the source than Id have liked. Most of the actors did excellent with the script they had. Although a couple of the bigger names fell flat. The movie left me with a tried too hard feeling.
Great visuals, story, and acting!
Supremely underrated film.
Movie was too long and boring at times.
The first 20 minutes or so could have easily been deleted and it would have made perfect sense. Felt a bit bloated at the beginning and it dragged at parts. Not the worst movie by far, but it was all right.
Slow at times, one love scene-not okay for kids good lead in for new Marvel characters.
I loved the overall storyline of this movie, it wasnt like your typical super hero movie. It was action packed, had great actors and a lot of twists and turns.
Started strong with typical Marvel action, but then slowed and got a little bogged down while the history behind the story unfolded. It was hard to follow the development of the characters, but as the story unfolded the pieces fell in place. It had a nice twist in the plot and a strong ending. It was an interesting and fun movie worth seeing.
Slow start. High highs, low lows.
The movie did not have as much action as inyhohhht it would have. I did like all the special effects though. Just thought it would be better from the trailer.
Filled with likable characters and fits well into the MCU Canon. Can I lay wonder if this sets the stage for the next MCU Mega Event.
I collect comic books since 76, it&#39;s ok, story line is different than the comic book. If you just go and watch it, and don&#39;t follow the comic book, ten it&#39;s ok, but he should make the storyline close to the comic book.
I feel like a lot of the movie was just underwhelming. The fight scenes were great and it kind of ties into the rest of the MCU but I feel like it’s more of a place setter. All they did was MAYBE set up the next big Villian in the MCU like how they did with Thanos. But, only time will tell🤷🏾‍♂️
Love the change up from a typical mcu movie!
Liked the way it explained how everything came about and had good action
The action was great
it was a long movie and there are scenes that don&#39;t really make sense, and it was just all over the place, very anticlimactic, and all around just kinda a dull movie, wasn&#39;t to impressed
It was long, kinda boring. Not very entertaining.
definitely slower than most MCU movies but it&#39;s a different story with complicated characters in a short period of time
The movie was a little slow moving. Needed a lot more action scenes. The plot was good. Musical score was great. Acting was good.
Adventurous, funny, and full of charm are a few words to describe my impact in watching Eternals. I was pleasantly surprised by the patience and care utilized to create the vision for this film. The time used to flesh out the actual Eternals was enjoyable and greatly illuminated the varying cultures impacted by the Eternals.
The story line was very confusing. Did not enjoy the movie.
Too long .. somewhat contrived . Angelica Jolie was superb — a real pro!
Slept through the 1st half and somewhere in the middle but my wife stayed wide awake n said it was good might go back n see this on that alone
Too long...too much explaining...too many characters....Just Bad all around
Much too long. Great story, but poor editing.
Great story with interesting plot twists. It seemed to start a bit slowly, but was enjoyable throughout.
Kept my interest start to finish at a pace that intensified only when appropriate. Color, SFX, Graphics, and musical score very well done. Character development was choppy, as were the interpersonal relationships, resulting in stifling the well-chosen Cast from embracing their roles or fully engaging with each other. The inserted teasers during the credits at the end were sharp and effective - definitely piqued my interest for the sequel(s). Also a clever trail of biblical allusions right up to the end was a nice touch leading into the holidays.
I abhor the idea that all human technology is from some random aliens sent to earth. also, why couldn&#39;t Makkari and Druig share a kiss on screen? so many things took me right out of my immersion
A different vibe for marvel and even though the stakes were as high as they could be, each character&#39;s (some more than others) world was smaller and more intimate. It made the whole movie feel scaled down, in a good way, and more personal.
Watched it again and liked it a lot better! It&#39;s a different Marvel film (they took a risk). You have to keep up with the time jumps but it all makes sense when you do. Marvel!!
It was very enjoyable, not cringe like black widow but not as good as say shang chi
Thought it was good. It&#39;s a slight departure from the average action marvel flick, because much was devoted to story development. As an origin story, with a descent size ensemble cast, I thought it was well done.
The sound was off in the theatre for the first 30 minutes of the movie
The story was great - not just action.
Visually and mentally stimulating from start to finish!
Awesome movie. Interesting story line. Great new group of characters. A step into a new Marvel universe. Cannot wait for for more!!
So so recommend this. Was not bad, but had some issues. All imma say without being a spoi boi
Beautifully filmed, but the story was a bit convoluted.
it was a solid movie especially for those with an interest in Greek and Roman mythology.
Enjoyed the characters and the concept of the movie. Looking forward to what will happen next.
Some scenes fell flat and while the fx were good, overall the direction was sub par.
Marvel does it again! Worth the watch, for sure. Great choice for the cast and music. I would watch it again.
Way to much to cover in your little time. Rushed
There was a more serious vibe to this Marvel film.
I&#39;d give it a 3.5 star if it was an option. the story was good, but this is so far of a back story, it has nothing to do with the MCU as we know it. the end credits made up for everything else.
Fascinating story, very exciting and great visuals
Good character development, exciting action sequences!
This movie was action packed. The modern day scenes were handled well. The back and forth between past and present was sometimes tedious but a necessary part to get the backstory.
Storyline feels inconsistent throughout the movie
The movie had lots of action and great story line. I like how it answered questions and tied other movies to it.
A little hard to follow the story line at times but a fun 3 hours just the same.
Contrived roles and cookie cutter superhero plot
The movie was too long and the story was hard to follow,
Hard to follow. Lighting was poor, heavy on the digital animation. Wish I hadnt gone!
Great movie. Special effects were amazing!
The end credits were good. Movie was ok.
The already slow and boring potline was convoluted with the &#34;love story&#34; between Sersi and Ikaris. It&#39;s understood that their relationship was meant to ground the storyline, but it all just seemed forced and entirely cliche at times - not to mention the unnecessary love scene. The screenplay was dull which didn&#39;t highlight the star-studded cast&#39;s potential. There were also numerous irrelevant scenes that didn&#39;t drive the plot along, but just served as fillers or cheap laughs. Overall, this film fell flat on pretty much every aspect aside from the cinematography.
Goes for an Epic/Classical scope as opposed to modern style of other MCU films. Kit Harrington adds nothing but everyone else is great. Recommend giving a shot if youre tired of the same superhero fare
The worst MCU movie so far. No reason for this movie to have been made. Long, slow, boring. No connection to the MCU as a whole other than a few references here and there.
Great cast, great story. Some plot twist
Long, slow, poorly written, occasionally poorly acted, and full of illogical character decisions. Top it off with some questionable editing choices and youve got my least favorite MCU film.
Great story. Unpredictable at times.
Amazing film, great action sequences and engaging story. Love the direction Marvel seems to be heading with their movies, they’ve not disappointed yet!
It was very entertaining and enjoyable. Great story.
I’m excited for the next Marvel adventures
Absolutely worth every minute
Great story line, however too drawn out.
Good movie with lots of plot twists. Some scenes werent a classic marvel movie but still a good movie to see!
Ver Amazing, this story is the actual Genesis to the Marvel Universe and love to see the Eternals Return
At times, the story line takes a while.
Loved theater very nice staff was very pleasant
Left me wanting to rewatch all the other Marvel movies and wanting more.
It was neither an action movie nor an artsy movie. Many parts were longer than they should have been. Some of the dialog seemed forced and out of place. My least favorite marvel movie so far.
It could have been great
Long and drawn out, great plot twists, great effects
This was one of Marvels worst movie
I liked this one, took a long time to get going. alot of story to tell first, then it got good.
It was so visually amazing and the story was awesome, and I loved 8 of the 10 eternals ( I didn’t like sprite or ikarus that much but your not supposed to )
Loved it! Can’t wait for part 2
All the characters did amazing jobs in role. It started a little slow, but it picked up quickly. I could&#39;ve lived without the back story and let it get filled in through the movie. However, it&#39;s true to Marvel standards, was consistently engaging throughout. Was taken back by one sex scene-parents beware.
The acting seemed a bit forced at times. Very drawn out plot fillers.
Too much dialogue, boring fight scenes, and a movie that didn&#39;t want to be long.
Long boring and confusing
I liked the unique quirks of the Eternals. It made the storyline we&#39;ve seen over and over again, new.
I loved it! I enjoyed getting to know the new Marvel characters &amp; cant wait for the next one. My husband felt the plot was broken up &amp; not free flowing, however, he enjoyed it too, but not as much as I did.
I liked it action packed the twist where the eternal with the laser eyes was partially the villain because he was blinded by the celestials but in the end they came together besides two eternals dying and saved earth from obliteration I didn’t like how they were told to stay put during the infinity saga though Iron man didn’t have to die but I understood why because without conflict and war their wouldn’t be love and nurture and growth because especially that one guy that can make people stop doing things and follow him for peace I can’t wait to see them face Doctor Doom and Galactis!
Fun movie with a good but inconsistent plot
The story line was easy to follow, the special effects were great.
excellent complex add to the Marvel universe superb cast
Not one of Marvels best ... story is confusing and characters not too interesting
Feels like there was a movie before this one we missed. But it doesn&#39;t exist. Not enough backstory to fully understand nor develop attachments to each character. I left the movie hyped up from the action but when it came to the rest I had more questions than answers. Ikaris was completely boring and Phastos deserved more screen time.
We thought it was GREAT! Full of action. It was rated PG-13 but there was only one scene that I had to cover my 10-year-old&#39;s eyes. And it was a scene that could have totally been kept out in my opinion....
A bit of a departure from Marvel’s normal movies. The beginning is not well written or directed, but the ending gets better. Interesting aspect of the MCU.
It was really action packed, exciting, and had a great twist. The acting was phenomenal too. Never a dull moment.
Love to see Angelina back in action. Great movie
Too confusing to follow
Movie theater was freezing couldn’t enjoy the movie
great movie...the Marvel universe never let&#39;s me down.
Was a little drawn out. Could have gone without some scenes that should have not been in the movie.
Eternals is Marvel Studios austerity at its finest.
On par with other Marvel films. If you like Marvel, you’ll love this. I did!
Watched it with my son, expected to see more connections to the other Marvel movies, but still loved it. Confused about Harry Sytles at the end.
good movie can&#39;t wait till part two!
terrible pacing, hardly any context, barely any interactions that were key to the plot. 2nd worst marvel move of 2021
This movies tries to rewrite human history. This is about (God, really god), Angels (Eternals), Deviants (demons) and humans. G(g)od is evil and is trying to destroy the Earth. The Angels / Eternals turn on god&#39;s plan and try to save the Earth. A male Eternal has a husband and kiss. There is a binary Eternal - can&#39;t tell if she is a girl or boy, but does get call a &#34;she&#34;.. Two eternals have sx. What this movie really is is: preparation for End Times. Eternals fight Deviants (Angels fight demons) all throughout the movie trying to protect mankind. God is judging the Earth during End Times and is portrayed as evil. The &#39;good&#39; people are those that love the Earth (gay family, binary and other Eternals) and trying to protect / save it from an evil god.
It was okay. Not Marvel’s best offering, but just…ok.
movie was to much story. found it boring
Great ideas and concepts but too little time. I liked it more for what it could have been than what it did. The movie was overwhelmed with what it was trying to do and each character deserved a deeper look into their philosophies. I would&#39;ve preferred if this was a tv series but still worth watching for what it does for the greater MCU story--especially in its post-credits scenes.
It was ok. It drug along at parts and probably could have been 2 hours or less. The action scenes were good. I just wish there had been more.
very disjointed and hard to follow.
While not on par with the older movies in the MCU, it is an enjoyable movie
I liked the story line so many ethical dilemmas and twists, turns and revelations. Some emotional parts and good effects.
It was a little slow.
Everybody loves super heroes but this movie was unnecessarily long with too many dead spots.
My son loved it! I enjoyed it too! We can&#39;t wait to see what happens next.
At the beginning it was challenging to follow... it was all over the place.... but I warmed up to e joy it by the end
It had a purpose in the MCU but it was definitely a miss! The most exciting parts of the movie were the end credit scenes.
Much enjoyed, for the length of the movie I was entertained, captivated in events. Loved incorporated history of mythology and events into the movie, by far my favorite aspect.
It seemed as if key elements of the story were missing. The missing element made me not care about the characters.
Funny and a good time at the movie theater, also sets up for more movies to come
not only worst marvel movie, but just an overall bad movie. Made no sense whatsoever and was frankly pretty stupid
amazing Cast, amazing special effects, great Movie in general
It was slow and too long. I felt zero connection to the characters. The jokes were repetitive and fell very flat
The storyline is inspiring and is definitely worth the watch.
Good storyline, one of the characters has a very weird twist. Did not have to be over two hours long
Such a great movie ! So much action and it was easy to follow the story line. Definitely recommend!
The best Marvel movie in my opinion. Can’t wait for the next installment.
Characters with nuance, beautiful pacing and gorgeous cinematography. A Marvel movie that doesn&#39;t dumb itself down. Fantastic.
The casting was perfect! Gemma Chan was smoking hot!
I liked the Eternals. Loved the visuals and that plot twist they put in it. I&#39;m an Angelina Jolie fan too. I can&#39;t wait to see part 2. It was slow in some spots, but you can&#39;t have action the whole time.
It is boring to see fights against monsters all the time.
I did like that it brought up thanos taking away half the life to pro long the celestial brith beings that thanos is a enteral him self coming from Kronos thanos actually is a Deviant of titans. Second most powerful in the comics. Kronos being strongest
most people described the movie as a divergent from typical marvel movie. it true, very slow and too much back story. save your money.
Enjoyed this very much. They setup all the characters nicely, which gave the viewer enough of a back story on each to begin all of their story lines.
I have no idea what kind of dope the critics be on but I personally enjoyed it. 7.5/10 for me. A few flaws but nothing for me to discredit it as a good film.
too slow more action
Didnt walk in with much expectations with what I heard about the movie, walked out surprisingly entertained. While it works as a setup for what is to come it was nice to see new characters come to life.
The movie was poorly written with a grossly structured storyline. Jokes were not funny and a bit forced. The coolest part of this movie was the closing credits!
Super mushy and very slow. I dont understand how it connects. Or how there could be more
I loved the characters and the cultures that were brought together. Some of the logic surrounding the magic was a little questionable but then again- it&#39;s not reality-based. Overall I enjoyed the movie and was entertained the whole time! Definitely leaves you wanting to know more.
Eternals was the beginning of their mission to earth and the story line behind the truth for their existence. I was glad the story explained why they weren&#39;t around to help the Avengers. I felt it was something missing in this, it&#39;s didn&#39;t excite me as much as the other movies, but it was good, I gave 5 stars because it did explain alot of questions for me.
Great complex plot. superb acting. great special effects. No easy to define heros or villains. One character for comic relief. Deals with serious issues we all face
I disliked this movie very much. I expect rainbows and kittens when I watch superhero flicks. If you want to see geriatric Angelina Jolie act like an angry child with reverse dementia, go watch it. I fell asleep and I usually pick on my husband for doing so. Slow, uninteresting, poor acting.
This was Marvel’s version of deep and I love deep and this was a new experience for me getting it in the design of a comic book movie and I was disappointed. I dropped a tear actually. DON’T JUDGE ME!
LONG!!! Lots of scenes could have been cut to save time.
Too long. Poorly casted. Barely interesting story. Rehashed special effects from other Marvel movies.
good story, pacing issues.
the sersi and ikaris scene was not revealing. I needed it to be longer and i needed more angles.
Excellent movie and refreshingly broke the Marvel mold - quieter moments, better representation, wildly creative. Action sequences were amazing and visually spectacular but never over done. Ignore the agenda-driven reviews.
Enjoy almost all Marvel movies, this movie did not disappoint
fantastic movie, I just wish it had been longer to flesh out all of the new characters
No plot at all. Horribly slow
Such a great Marvel film. I knew it was going to be this good
There is no climax. No character build up. Very simple storyline. No surprises.
it was long, but it kept me engaged. whenever things got too serious or too cheesy, they pulled it back with some comedy.
I didn’t love it or hate it. It’s not something I would recommend paying to see in the theater. Decent storyline but it was slow and not the action packed movie to expect with a marvel movie
The characters are ok. Curious to see how this works into the larger MCU.
Started out slow, but the last act was awesome!
This movie was way better than I thought it would be. The storytelling was excellent, special effects, and the pace was accurate to follow and understand the storyline.
I liked the premise...however...I don&#39;t think the backstory was very well developed. This surprised me because Marvel usually does this very well.
I thought it was good, good enough for a sequel. I think all the hate is from a scene involving 2 males on an affectionate level, so sad really.
Good action and some comedic elements
Good movie. When you have over a 2 1/2 hour movie you need to keep the pace up...was a little slow in a couple spots.
the storyline was a bit confusing in the beginning until later explained. the time travel helped tell the story. the actors all played their parts well. the costume and special effects were amazing. I can tell there will be a sequel....didnt care for the ending as much
Amazing movie! 10/10 would definitely recommend.
Good story, great acting &amp; great setup for the MCU going forward.
absolutely terrible. boring and anticlimactic! what a waste
What a gigantic waste of time, money and energy! I get why Chloe Zhao would want to do it cuz it&#39;s a huge payday, but if you&#39;re gonna sell out to The Man by making a mainstream movie like this you should at least make it actually entertaining. Terrible script that constantly, needlessly and confusingly jumps back and forth in time, weird casting, anemic directing, lame FX, way too long, way too slow -- I was gritting my teeth in the theater just waiting for it to end. Couple of little funny &#34;Marvel-esque&#34; moments here and there, but all the straight drama/action parts were complete duds cuz at no point do the main characters do anything at all to make you really like or care about them at all. In closing, here is one example of why this movie is so crazy-making: I&#39;m all for diversity in casting, but it makes ZERO sense for one of the god-like Eternals to be deaf! Shouldn&#39;t she have had &#34;super-hearing&#34; just like all the other Eternals who had &#34;super-something&#34;? Also she has super speed and is basically the &#34;The Flash&#34; of the movie??? Why??? What does being deaf have to do w/ having super speed? They could have easily found another way to let that Eternal character have super speed, and then write in a non-Eternal deaf character with a much more compelling storyline rather than shoehorning her into the role she occupies in this movie (and BTW not putting down actress who played part, she&#39;s great -- but just shouldn&#39;t have been playing character she played.)
just bad. bad writing bad lines. forced acting. no chemistry among the characters.
It was a pretty good movie!
It was as rousing as any Marvel movie but I never felt a connection with the characters. Everyone felt like they were just a talk show guest and got enough exposure to pique your interest but not real substance to their presence. The story was predictable. Lovely CGI and special effects, but it was just a big show. I never warmed up to it and CARED. I hope this was a one off by the director and not a new theme.
Hard to understand...no real explanation of the characters
Epic story in the tradition of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings about the past, present and future of the world. It is now MY Movie of the Year.
Left half way through, not worth watching this non event. A stupid story with no connection to anything. Not even good fantasy.
Very good, fun, lots of action. A few strange aspects that never got explained, and I&#39;m not going to describe them here and spoil things for people, but overall very good.
it was predictable in the way that many marvel movies are, but I liked that. it left more room for the audience to see more of the characters and their struggles. lots of little laughs here and there. seeing so many diverse characters on screen was a big plus as well.
Creative storyline and interesting characters and relationships. Humor and action in line with MCU style, even though the characters are new.
Its the Art and Philosophical movie of the MCU. The film is very somber and delves into some deep themes. Its not for everyone but I liked it.
The movie was kind of everywhere for poeple that are casual marvel fans. The CGI was great they could have made the deviants a little harder to beat. And they maybe could have got some better actors or just better powers for the eternals
Liked the pacing, the intimacy, the relationships, the amount of time spent on teambuilding, the diversity of race, ability and sexuality in the cast. Wasn&#39;t a fan of having a black gay character claiming responsibility for something absolutely atrocious and 100% America&#39;s fault.
This is a great movie, it&#39;s not a action like other marvel movies, but, at least, this one have a different touch thayt it makes me to enjoy it in different kind of perspective, like the story, characters and the environment.
This was an amazing movie. The plot twist, humor, and love stories were to die for. The diversity was beautiful
Great diversity and very entertaining!!
Spectacular fight scenes and character development. Some movies do not need to explore multiple love interests and lifestyles and has no bearing on the plot. Overall it was good but I will not buy it on DVD or watch it again.
Beautiful special effects and interesting story.
I felt a complete disconnect from the MCU. I understand producers were wanting a new direction, but this was a movie of complete confusion. So many different unnecessary parts. The story line was too far out there and did not keep me hooked at all. I actually fell asleep half way through. Sorry, not the movie I was hoping for this time.
This movie was pretty bad. It tries to cram too much content into just one movie. The final battle was agonizingly long and boring. It felt like the creators of the film had no idea what they wanted to do with the last battle and just threw random things into the mix just for fun. The characters motivations don’t make much sense either. Kingo was a big Bollywood actor on this version of Earth and was very famous. But he was totally content with the world ending. Like dude why do you want the world to end u have the most to lose if it does happen. You lose your entire acting career that you have been working towards for 100’s of years. The characters in this movie are also extremely flat and boring. They don’t have much of a personality and frankly speaking I couldnt give much of a shit about any of them. I hope that in future marvel properties they will improve these characters and make them less boring. Too sum up my review this was a pretty disappointing film. This movie had everything a really good director(Chloe Zhao) and a talented cast. I just wish the writing could have been a bit better. To end of on a positive note the movie looks really nice. It is shot really well and the special effects look very good.
the cast is amazing! the plot was good, the ending could&#39;ve been better. somewhat of a cliffhanger id say, but nonetheless a great movie!
definitely needs better editing and could have had 45 min cut from it. the acting was wooden and pacing was a slog.
Had a really fun time watching the movie, was entertained all the way through.
Really liked the movie but thought Angelina Jolie was a poor fit in the movie ...
The action sequences were incredible and they did a great job of providing context to the characters thy helped you care about what was happening.
it was ight...the last 2 mins was the best part!!! cliffhanger
Not having read the comics, I found the movie a bit confusing and convoluted. It was entertaining and Im glad that I saw it in the theater.
im thinking maybe it was just too much story to tell. not enough about the individuals and who they are. would have loved to love the characters more. we were entertained but longed for more
Great movie as are all the marvel movies. The special effects were amazing. The right actor&#39;s were picked for the heroes that they played
Good flick. More serious than most MCU films, and the middle third was a bit slow, but overall well done, and I look forward to seeing some of these characters in future MCU films.
Stunning visuals, lengthy
very good sign language woman
Great show! Starts a little slow but gets better quickly. Be sure to stay all the way to the end of the credits for a super relevant bonus scene.
Excellent movie nothing to confusing for none comic book fans tells a good story and leads up to some awesome new characters
Well casted,entertaining, good music
Length of the movie was unesssary long
It didn&#39;t make me feel like I was watching a Marvel movie. It was a disappointment.
Meh. Overly coplex plot. Marvels just gets weirder every time
Two very strong themes, &#34;does the good of the many outweigh the rights of the few&#34; (the Trolley problem writ large) and, &#34;can G-d be wrong?&#34;. All this without any sense of preachiness, lots of humor, and a plot that moves right along.
Another good Marvel movie.
Liked the action scenes and it was funny
This movie was very introspective. Often the quiet moments were the best. There wasn&#39;t a clear good/evil dynamic in the film and that&#39;s what sets it apart from other marvel films. This isn&#39;t a story about the good guys winning the fighting, but a story about defending your beliefs and holding onto until the very end no matter the cost. It&#39;s a story about love and the different ways people interpret it. This movie was a fantastic drama and it was great to get lost into it. I feel like the fight scenes were the weakest only because there was no dialogue. The conversations in the movie really drove it. this movie was great and everyone should go see it.
Plot , it was all over the place.
I believe it&#39;s to long for the amount of content. It didn&#39;t feel like a traditional Marvel movie. Boring.
Too long and drawn out I slept through half of the movie. The worse Marvel movie I&#39;ve experienced so far. oof, the was Rotten.
I have enjoyed most of the Marvel movies since Iron Man. This movie unfortunately suffered from many writing flaws including the original premise which should have been retconned. There was no real chemistry between the characters and only three or four that you could connect with. Richard Madden&#39;s acting as Ikaris was flat and uninteresting, to the point that the twist in his story was no surprise. The evolved deviant was slap-dashed in and out and seemed to be going somewhere but didn&#39;t. Just a mess of a plot. Costuming and visuals were pretty decent.
Good movie but leaves you hanging in the end.
It&#39;s amazing I Love the fact that the LGBTQ+ community was represented
I loved the storyline. Everything came together so well! It kept me interested the entire time.
great flick. felt like I was watching an epic Greek comedy!
great action humor storyline was good
Slow, unlikeable characters &amp; extremely predictable. Awful.
It starts out real slow, Kind of boring. But about 23 of the way into the movie you get the action in the animation that you went to see.
Jabba the Hut snorting next to me
Good amount of action, wonderful example of inclusion of different types of people. Perhaps too many characters (didnt quite catch all the names) &amp; at times story a bit disjointed, but fun.
Cheesy effects, story is hard to follow became boring.
surprisingly deep and emotional, particularly for a comic book movie, maybe a bit much. they worked hard to have character development, again, a lot for a single movie. perhaps if each character had their own movie for that first, like The Avengers did, there could be more. Of course it had to have the now obligatory diversity quota and gay-inclusion, but it doesn&#39;t detract from the film. Happy to have seen it on the big screen, but, unlike the Avengers films, it is not one to watch repeatedly.
This was just self serving with little action or actual meaning.
Loved the plot, characters, and CGI.
It was hard to follow at first, a lot of jumping back and forth in time but once the twist came, it all made sense.
Don’t listen to the critics. If you’re a fan of the marvel universe you will enjoy this movie.
Worst Marvel movie ever we&#39;ll never go see another Marvel movie again until they bring back the original characters
The movie was alright!
Good movie...great special effects. I&#39;m just more familiar with the Avengers type characters.
It got off to a slow start
Great visuals, plot, and acting. Only drawback...too long
Actually nodded off for a few minutes. Boring at times which is odd for a Marvel movie. Definitely the wrong algorithm for this story.
I Really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to real Marvel fans
It was good. Although there were was some slow parts in the middle.
It was a good movie to watch, a little different from the rest of the marvel movies. This one is informative, a lot of details, looking like they&#39;re laying out the ground work for the sequels to come!
I really liked it. it kept me engaged and made me a little emotional
This movie was horrible and WAY too long! The story line was boring and strange
This movie reminds me of why I love cinema. These types of stories, they live within us. The stories of our shortcomings as well as our greatest successes, and our strengths as well as our unresolved light. We are beautifully complicated, and that&#39;s what makes us human.
So boring! Bad plot, bad acting. We left after an hour. Waste of time and money
Fantastic action sci-fi movie about good fighting evil with great superhero action, deception, revelation and champions doing the right thing -- we knew Celestials were evil from Guardians of the Galaxy. Great acting and can&#39;t wait to see Eternals 2 when Thena, Makkari and Druig go with Eros to save Sersi, Phastos and Kingo from the evil world destroying Celestial Arishem. We need to learn the backstory of Thanos and Eros as the detailed and elaborate MCU Multiverse continues to unfold.
LOVED the story line and character development!
Long, disjointed rambling garbage. Typical of Disney to run a franchise like Marvel into the ground for the freaking !
Well, it&#39;s a superhero movie so to be expected, the visuals were amazing. However, the script was poor clunky and stilted. The scenes when characters expostulated with &#34;mini monologs&#34; weren&#39;t effectively woven into the overall arc of the story, so the messages intended lost their relevance. I was frankly shocked someone let this script get to screen. As the genre goes, overall it was average.
Don’t take your kids to see this movie. La película tiene mucha basura.
A good addition to the MCU, stoked to see what else is done with the Eternals
Liked story plot twist. And a dude flew into the sun. Disliked how fast the big deviant died and bad words
I liked Harry&#39;s cameo. I disliked the part Ikaris because he betrayed everyone near the end,
Really liked this movie !
Great movie. Nice story line. A must see
Eternals is misnomer. Eternals should/could/will not die. Oops And movie appeared disjointed. Action scenes. A little dialogue more action scenes. No real flow, at least not to me.
It was a great movie
this film was completely unable to build meaningful character relationships. they TOLD us that the characters loved each other and cared about the world, but showed it very poorly. I think this particular film really lived and died by our ability to connect with the characters and failed in that job.
The storyline had some unexpected twists, kept me in suspense. I know some people criticize the number of characters, that it is too hard to keep track, and some didn&#39;t get enough screen time. Do a little research on the characters beforehand, and it flows well. Bit some of the characters did get cheated on screen time. But hey, it&#39;s a Marvel movie, there will be sequels!!
Too slow and dragging
better than the advangers
awesome movie, great acting and story. enjoyed every minute, looking forward to seeing what happens next
I like when they&#39;re like the Avengers. I did not like when 2 of them got killed &amp; another 2 turned purely evil.
Loved it great story and fight scenes
I loved every minute of it
Not what I expected. Very slow and kind of boring.
Has some slow parts in the beginning but great ending. Stay for the credits.
Visually spectacular! But that&#39;s pretty much all it has. The story was shallow and not well thought out. The acting was spotty as well.
A really different take on the superhero genre - to say why or how would give away too much of the plot, but suffice it to say that you probably haven&#39;t seen another Marvel movie quite like this one. The acting ensemble was excellent -- they shone individually and supported each other beautifully. The humor was gentler, but sufficient to balance out the more self-serious side of the story. So cool that they gave this to Chloe Zhao to direct -- I could feel the more feminine sensibility at work, and it really elevated the film above the typical Marvel fare. Recommended.
Good movie. Good plot. definitely PG-13. Beware, there is a sex scene. It&#39;s a more mature film than normal Marvel.
Extremely slow and repetitive love story plot drags this movie on and on. I think maybe a group of 5th or 6th graders might have written this script. None of the comedic relief is funny at all. Not one of the main characters endures you to them. Absolutely zero connection from the audience to the story. The worst marvel movie ever.
Didnt like major changes to story of Eternals. No gay eternals, deviants werent speechless monsters, etc
PG-13!?!? Yeah, right. My children did not need to see two lovers laying down naked, rocking back and forth. Sex scenes don&#39;t belong in a PG-13 movie. Very disappointed in Disney&#39;s lack of judgment on what is appropriate content for kids to see.
The movie was awesome!
the movie was amazing it definitely makes you want to watch it again I will be waiting for it to come out on dvd
I am a Marvel fan and I always love superheroes movies. This one really is a big disappointment. The story was dragging and had no sense whatsoever.
Lots of action, loved the movie
It brings a new magic to Marvel
The action was good but the story line stupid
confusing, bad story
It was a great movie. Lots of action, plots and very entertaining.
Very disjointed, almost had to be a fan of comic books first for this one. Dont think it will have broad appeal.
Maybe part 2 is what I expected from part 1
Started a little slow but had a good storyline &amp; line, as it progressed. Great plot twist, ending and sneak peak at the sequel.
Impossible to follow the plot!
I liked the movie. it wasn&#39;t really a marvel movie. More mythology based. but good movie
New meta perspectives in MCU. Will be baseline for deeper, wider storylines. Imaginative, moral dilemmas that makes you at least think.
Very different for the Marvel universe. Amazing nonetheless though. Great pacing and nice interesting plot
Hit every aspect of inclusive and diversity. Accurate representations of multiple cultures. Great balance of action and story.
I didnt know what to think because I have read so many unpleasant reviews about the movie. It definitely wasnt the worse movie I have seen. From 1-10, 10 being one of the best movie I have seen I would give it a 7. I would go see the second Eternal movie when it comes out.
It was a little slow. Had good visuals. And a decent story line.
Great movie! The character moments were hilarious and representation was refreshing to see in a Marvel movie. It was a little dense in the Marvel mythos and might be a little hard to follow if your just a casual Marvel fan, but if youve seen all the way to End Game - youre good!
Damn too long and slow
This movie is a solid 5. Acting, directing, special effects, plot. characters all a 5. Not good, not bad. A good show for the kids on a rainy Saturday afternoon 10 years from now on syndication. Hopefully the sequel. if there must be one, will be better.
Horrible. Won&#39;t do marvel ever again.
Was a really great movie hope there’s a sequel with the way it ended
Like: Interesting plot with earths history nicely tied in + double post credits clues on sequels (need wait til very very end! Dislike: Confusing on back &amp; forth on good vs evil amongst the characters, though surely written for the twists, but somewhat felt tiring by the second half of the movie.
A somewhat different kind of MCU movie- and I really liked it!
This movie was way to long. Dragged on for hours, was overall pointless and really repetitive. Maybe if it was 30 mins. Not recommend.
Angelina Jolie was excellent.
I loved it, but a little long. I would see again.
Good story.. little difficult to follow at 1st but good
Better than average Marvel movie. It loses some points for being a bit too long/dragging in parts as well as the weird overly CGI looking Deviants. But a solid introduction to a new team of heroes.
Thought it was very good. Only reason it’s not a perfect five is because of all the jumping around timeframes. I really enjoyed this otherwise
It was pretty good. Didn’t love or hate it. Some of the fight scenes were well executed. I felt there was too much joking around.
Wish there was more backstory instead of the flashbacks
The movie was stupid. I don&#39;t say that about many movies, but this lived down to the word stup id.
So well done, tasteful, great movie!
Great special effects and quite a bit of action. There were several slower spots in the movie where they fleshed out the backstories of the characters. All in all, though, as long as you don&#39;t mind the premise of the movie, it was really good.
Eternals is now the base for the new Marvel Universe. It was entertaining yet left you with a million questions. Stay thru the end.........
The movie was entirely too long and had nothing to really keep either my self or oldest son awake. I wouldn’t recommend going to see this . I was just glad it was over .
A little slow in places but a good movie.
Started really slow. Selma Hayek had most of the dialog for the first 20 mins which of course her acting was pretty atrocious. Middle of the movie was pretty good. Formed together well, lost me with and end credit introduction. Fill cgi hobbit-like character expected a bit more from them. It was very cartoony, and not on par with the cgi deviants from the rest of the movie. Very disconnected. And I LOVE the person who was voicing the character. Just wish they would have had him live action. Felt very Jar-Jar Binx.
Sorry but we wanted to like this movie but it was so corny. Very disappointing
Fun movie, some characters were fleshed out better than others but the mix of action and exposition was pretty good! You don’t necessarily need to understand the MCU to enjoy it which is a plus.
it was slow.. no surprises of plot or whats to come.
Great story, pulled a lot of the Marvel movies together. Super characters. Wow on the cinematography, locations and costumes.
Very nice visual effects. I felt sleepy but the scenes kept me awake the entire time.
Too much storyline not enough action
Movie was pretty badass, enjoyed the story and action sequence. Definitely worth watching
The Pros: Off the charts terrific CG special effects and action laced with occasional quick humor Every minority is represented in positive ways The Eternals superpowers and very unique story line Kind of neat to see the romance kindle between certain External pairs The sheer beauty of Salma Hayek and Angelina Jolie and Gemma Chan--Wow!!! The Cons: Mind numbing CG effects. A good dash here and there is fine, but non-stop gets dizzying. Unique story line is a good thing, but so many twists will make it hard to follow for many. The movie is 2hrs 37minutes long about 40 minutes too long.
Awesome movie. A lot of action. A little long.
I loved how the characters were alien but relatable and complex, the pacing felt right, and the effects were spot on.
Great action - story complex enough but not too much - great characters
Great movie make sure you have seen all other marvel movies
The storyline progression was a bit slow compared to most marvel movies and not as much action. Good cliffhanger though. Stay until after the credits because there are 2 cliff hanger endings like most Marvel movies have.
If you like movies that have a slow burn, youll dig this. I enjoyed how it took its time, definately not your typical super hero flickwhich is just fine by me. I thought the payoff was totally worth it.
Loved the balance of humor, story, and action. And Gamma Chan gave an absolute awesome performance.
Nice retool for Marvel. Liked the action and storyline. Look forward to see how these develop over time.
This was a good standalone movie from marvel. There shouldve been a ton more action as there was too much of a storyline and didnt make a lot of sense.
I quite liked it! The first Marvel movie in a while where I actually felt the stakes
extremely disappointed especially since all the other marvel movies are so great
Loved it, any thing that Marvel does is good so far. It is a must see.
Riveting saga that was true to the spirit of the comics. I look forward to the sequels!
I might need to watch it again. I was not impressed.
Loved it! Great job Marvel!
Too long and drawn out. Overall marginal for Marvel. Good FX
Awesome production, you have to have knowledge of Marvel production to fully enjoy the quality.
Only Special effects &amp; stereotypes
Too long, story line...eh.. all the hype on the cgi.. brah Aquaman cgi way more intense. Big let down
Good pace. Interesting characters. Great story. I didnt know all of the back story.
It was horrible. Too much talking and who wants to watch a superhero with dementia. WeirdI expected better role by Angelina. Was disappointed
It was a strange movie
The movie was so slow. The best part was trailer for next movie.
The characters were not likable and pace of the plot was too slow.
Felt movie dragged on. Not enough action. Lead character in my opinion was not strong enough. Was eagerly awaiting exciting things to happen throughout movie.
Opens the MCU to all new possibilities. Awesome movie.
It was a bit long could have shaved about 30 minutes off
My family and I loved the movie. It had a lot of twists and turns.
it was awesome. I definitely enjoyed watching it.
It was entertaining but the mythology is seriously mixed up and the special effects were good but not great
Good story line. Logical sound plot. Good effects and scenery.
Graphics and story. Cant wait for sequel.
Terrible, waste of our time, boring movie. My husband fell asleep and he didn&#39;t miss a thing. A big disappointment!
Good special effects, hated jumping around from now to then.
It was a Marvel movie, how could you go wrong?!
very entertaining ☺️
Too much time devoted to character development, must wait for sequel to see if series is going to be very good, So far not very entertaining.
Was a great film throughout never bored excited to see what comes next!
It was good, but dragged a bit. Three hours was too long.
Very slow… complex storyline and not the typical Marvel film we have come to know in 20+ films. Also did NOT need the overtly homosexual scene in front of my young kids!
There&#39;s a massive story to be told here but fitting it into a movie doesn&#39;t do it justice. This would have been better off as a series on Disney Plus.
Watched it twice. I love how the director got all details. From the movie, I can see that she studied hard about actors and story of eternals. If you focused on details - recommened If you expect something excited - not recommended
Horrible story telling, terrible plot, nothing made sense, easily the worst Marvel movie ever
bad pacing, didn&#39;t stick very well to the source material at all
This movie is phenomenal! It was way better than I thought it would be. Yes, the antagonist&#39;s behavior was a bit predictable, but overall it is well produced. There was a moment where my emotions got the best of me so that has a lot to say about this film!
Good building story for the next series
Marvel is a machine. good movie and great destination where they shot the film.
The teenagers loved it!
I liked it a lot two thumbs up. Can’t wait to see where they take this new world of characters
Super slow and lame total wast of time. Had to leave because we couldn’t take it any longer.
That the characters were named after and portrayed Greek and other mythical individuals!
Great story and wonderful acting.
Its great to have a new superhero movie that tells the beginningor at least close. Gives us an idea of where Superman came from. Flash and such.
I think I liked the movie.....I am a little on the fence. I would watch it again (at home) to make a final determination. There were some good characters developed. They did a good job setting the stage for the next one.
not very engaging. doesn&#39;t tie in to the other movies very much. too long
Recommend this movie to anyone excellent show for all ages.
great movie, awesome storyline
Horrible movie. Don’t go see it. That’s coming from a huge MCU fan. So boring I fell asleep and decided to walk out halfway through.
Confusing plot, stupified acting, disjointed score: Saturday morning kids stuff.
Much longer than it needs to be…. Plot slows down often unnecessarily. Overall okay but plenty of plot holes and forced suspension of disbelief.
I enjoyed how different it felt from other Marvel movies. Most marvel films feel like a sci-fi action film where as this film felt like a epic fantasy story.
Full of action and I enjoyed the character development
I would say a pretty solid movie. I like the characters and their adventures and stories on earth, didnt care for the overarching theme with the Celestial stuff.
IMO the movie was ok. It didn&#39;t have a very good story line. They believe they are super heroes only to find out they are actually not. They were created to destroy another creation that evolved &amp; became wise.
Great story with a lot of action
Diversity of cast and character depth.
This was a very good and lovable movie I enjoyed everything about it
I really liked this movie. Not a typical MCU movie. I get that they need to venture beyond the heroes that we&#39;re used too. I&#39;m looking forward to the sequel &amp; hopefully the filling in of some minor plot holes.
too long didn’t watch
Great concepts, but terrible execution. Movie seemed much longer than it had to be.
I bought tickets for the wrong theater and couldn’t return or exchange them because the show had already started
everything was below average. the only thing i liked was Angelina Jolie’s character, Druig, the guy who can freaking build stuff too and Makai. Everyone else is okay. plot was too long.
I get Marvel wanted to put a same sex couple in this movie...but did they need have a kissing scene? Is this not a children&#39;s movie. Also the focus on the love scenes where drawn out about 20 minutes too long. The fighting scenes were excellent.
I found it slow to start, too much history, that could have been compressed and saved 10/15 minutes. Ending was good and set nicely up for the second one.Good cast and well acted.
Not marvels best movie but also not it’s worst. I Wasn’t expecting it to be fantastic. Critics are definitely exaggerating with their reviews. It is very long and and a little slow but picks up eventually. More of a drama than a marvel movie.
too much packed into 2 and half hours should have been show on Disney plus
Might be the best one so far.
Predictable, dry, lacking personality
Can&#39;t wait to see the next one, and how they might possibly incorporate them into future MCU films.
Great cast and interesting story.
A lot of action in fight scenes, though characters could have used a little more backstory and/or development. Overall, a great MCU film.
Great movie! Great acting! Want to see another!
Action heroes with no action.
too long, most of it didn&#39;t make sense
Don&#39;t believe the reviews, this was very refreshing after all the predictable, formulaic, rushed marvel movies
I don&#39;t think anyone would fall asleep watching this movie. It had a few twists and was action packed. I enjoyed it very much and look forward to the next Eternals movie
This is NOT a super hero movie. It&#39;s a Greek Tragedy, very heavy and not fun. It&#39;s entertaining, but not exciting and fast-paced. It&#39;s a drama with pithy, pointed moral lessons. Kevin Feige should have expected a movie such as this considering the director he hired.
It was confusing. Jumped from one thing to another. Even the actors seemed bored! Very disappointing.
Movie was super long for no reason.
So slow we both fell asleep! Not much of a movie. We were disappointed because there are a lot of good actors in the cast. Have to give it a thumbs down.
Definitely not one of Marvel’s best. The CGI was great but as a Marvel fan. I definitely came out of the theater wanting more. Marvel has abandoned its roots. Disappointing.
I like the fact that the cast was diverse but the story was kind of confusing. It wasn&#39;t that structured. YES I watched the other movies and know some comics but this movie wasn&#39;t all that.. They only thing that kept me awake was with a few jokes from the movie. The special effects were cool for sure but for this movie I didn&#39;t feel anything.
Too long. Repetitive. Told the story but could have been done more succinctly.
Marvel definitely let the ball drop on this one. It’s hard to get through and tough to follow.
I think it would have been better if they broken it up into a mini series like they did Loki. I feel like they tried to tell too many stories simultaneously and in doing so they didnt do justice to any of them . It was boring . Especially compared to what marvel has already given us .
Amazing movie that’s just starting the next phase of the MCU. A must see!
Good - slow in parts
It was alright, definitely didn’t hit like other Marvel films for me. Was not taken with Circe as a “leader”, wallflower felt more appropriate for a lot of the group scenes post promotion. Thena was a badass for about 10% of her air time and a liability for the rest which effectively voided the draw of even having Jolie play, a bummer since it was definitely a point I had been excited about. The strange cliff hanger of a identity reveal for the mortal boyfriend Circe helped cultivate struck me as odd being that, really, how could she not know his family history unless she straight up didn’t care? Icarus throwing himself into the sun following his defeat smacked of tantrum. And the brother of Thanos thing at the end felt very contrived, first time I’ve reflexed an eye roll instead of excitement following a new character intro.. also, the notion that the infant celestial was empathetic enough to off itself for humanity’s sake was a reach, especially for how pissed the prime was about it. I felt like they had been painted up to be far more omnipotent removed from the emotional plane with more emphasis on the grand scale, but what do I know. Also, how is it the prime didn’t react while they were hatching their plot? They’re linked by the golden sphere? No alert went off while it was being altered? Weird. Strangest thing to me since Iron Man being let to die, the dude straight up ran on batteries.. Pepper didn’t even try, as a fan, I would have appreciated them at least making the effort to really show he was too far gone, but I digress..
While this movie was not perfect, I thought it was an enjoyable watch with some interesting characters.
Unlike any other Marvel movie. It brings a sense of heart to the MCU that we have not seen yet. Externals will take the MCU in a whole new direction.
I followed the story line very well. Cinematography was awesome.
Great story. Characters with depth. Grand visuals.
I liked all of it It was a well done movie
Kinda just sucked and have no idea how it connects to marvels MCU
I liked that it introduced a whole new set of heroes and gives an interesting spin on our beginnings.
Nice effects. Slow story, flat characters hard to sympathize with, derivative storyline of largely unfamiliar characters. Not credible.
Not what I expected, but Im ready to watch the sequal
As a mcu fan, it was amazing.
They needed to build the characters up better.
Well represented, Kind of long for Young Children. Enjoyed it much with my family
Kool movie, great special effects and very interesting .
Wish it had a better character buildup
The only Marvel movie that doesn’t follow the Marvel formula. Chloe Zhao never disappoints.
Great special effects and a good story. This is the second time Ive seen it.
Too long. Horrible woke script. Worst marvel movie including Ironman 3.
Lousy. All 7 boys age 9-13 hated it. Even my 10 year old who loves marvel said it was awful. My husband 50 also thought it was dull, too chatty, and too “message driven” to be any good.
Was not what i expected. Was pretty good but the story was a little convoluted and too little action.
It was really slow and inappropriate it was ok
Slow areas in the middle.
It was nice to see the history of Celestials, Eternals and Deviants for those of us that have not read many comics on the subject. It took a few twists and turns that I was not expecting. Unfortunately, they had to bow to the &#34;woke people&#34; and make one Eternal gay, that was just stupid. I missed the second end-credit scene, however, was briefed about it. I will catch it on one of my streaming apps. I thought the casting was done very well. DC seems to have a problem with that right now. So in all a very good movie. Lastly, Angelina Jolie has a chemical effect on me no matter what role she plays.
we enjoyed it. can&#39;t wait till the next one...
Started rather slow. Sometimes confusing storyline.
LOVED everything about this movie. Once again, Marvel did not disappoint!
I thought it was very entertaining.
Very confusing plot. Action &amp; special great.
Poor story line, too convoluted and characters were too fake. The movie was much too long. Poor editing.
Loved how the mcu is mixing universes!!! Bringing more of the less known comic heroes into it.
This was the worst Marvel movie I&#39;ve ever seen. They forgot to use storytelling..
For a Marvel movie a little light on the action and more storyline than usual. Understand this is introducing brand new characters to the masses. Having said that, a lot of characters with little background and insight to their individual story. Next installment should be much better.
Couldn&#39;t get behind any &#34;hero&#34; and not witty like other Marvel movies.
Another great Marvel movie. Great cast and visuals and good story with some twists and laughs.
It was good to see a new take on superhero
I love super hero movies and I really like the story line of this movie
I loved the movie, of course I love all things Marvel .... still, I loved the movie &amp; would recommend people to go see it!
Alot of movie crammed into one that could have been two
if you are into Marvel movie then it is a must see.
Great special effects and great acting. A new dimension of Marvel movies.
I liked it because it was a cool movie with a lot of unexpected events, I loved the characters and all their different personalities! I feel like there should’ve definitely been more action, or more larger action. Overall, it was a good movie and I don’t regret spending money on it. I would definitely recommend!
Slow and boring. Disappointing for a Marvel movie.
Cast attire looked outdated, along with some of the special powers and effects. Storyline was continually misplaced for me. It felt forced to be current one minute, back in time the next and the only way of knowing was to read the subtle. Smoother transition could eliminate those issues. The content was boring at times, to say the least. We love Marvel Movies and Eternal did not make the cut. Seems that the Costume designer dress majority of the cast on a tight budget, their special effects &amp; powers were outdated, (1979 Lost &amp; Space - black &amp; white TV) Thankfully, we experienced a couple of laughs- which kept us awake. Ready for DUNE
Absolutely loved it, Phase 4 will be amazing
Took my 12 year old son and love the movie. the only thing I wish wasn&#39;t in movie was sex scene.
Very pretty locations, has a lot of promise to it but just too much happening for one movie.
This is actually a bit different from the normal Marvel formula and that&#39;s why I like it. Great message about humanity, diversity and tolerance And no stupid fighr with a CGI cresture at the end!
loved it, action was over the top. graphics extremely appealing, constantly moving upward. Characters played phenomenally, great abilities. never seen a marvel movie, and the trailer after the credits, sweet. so don&#39;t leave the theater till you&#39;ve seen it all!!!!
Had a semi sex scene and I had my 12 yr old son. Mavel comics NEVER have sex scenes! Also it had some ridiculous boring scenes that should have been taken out of the film. I also don&#39;t agree with the liberal idea that two men can be married to each other and I find the kissing between them to be disgusting and obscene, Other than that, It had some great action scenes and the special effects were fantastic. I would never go back to see the sequel unless they correct their mistakes and go back to the good old successful Marvel storylines that I grew up with and loved since i was a kid when I collected thousands of comic books and aspired to be like so many of the super heroes that I admired,
Great movie. My family enjoyed it.
Despite a few good scenes, this movie fell flat. There was no real drama or tension or reasons to care about the fate of the characters. Overall it was pretty boring.
too much googly eyes love story for a marvel movie
Liked the diversity and mix of action and intensity. Did not like the guys kissing or the obvious sex scene (even though nothing was shown).
I really loved the story and the action! It was definitely different kind of marvel film. But the kind of story it told was beautiful. Purpose, belief, morals and what they mean to you, drive, and humanity. It was great to see. The design of the characters was so unique. The twists were great! My only critique was I wished they showcased Sersi more to give her character more depth, idk something was missing for me considering what the movie wanted you to see from her. But overall I loved the movie!
Great film! A beautiful and epic journey of beings who are unlike the heroes of the MCU that we&#39;ve become use to, and it&#39;s a good thing that these characters can be quite jarring to the viewer. This ambitious project is a signpost that it&#39;s time for the MCU to shake things up!
There were some twist and turns. Kept my interest throughout the movie. It was very good.
Liked all the complex characters as well as the relationships between those characters. Century spanning time periods and settings. Even though there are people rating this movie poorly, there are positives such as how it reinvents the Marvel Universe I&#39;m interesting out of the box ways. Definitely do not listen to criticism ratings and decide for yourself by actually seeing the movie and make up your own mind:) 👍👍👍
Unconventional by Marvel standards with a great narrative which dropped hints for the next stages of the MCU
It was hard to follow, too long, and kind of dull.
Amazing movie, would rewatch it again
decent film. not the greatest, not the worst. overall enjoyable but they tried to slam alot down your throat.
interesting story, great action. But slow developing and kinda puzzling what was going on. 🤔
Long movie that took forever to get to the point.
This was a hot mess. Good special effects (although repetitive), adequate acting but incomprehensible plot.
This Movie was amazing. but definitely need to wait for the post credits after everything is done. enjoy everyone!
some more Marvel-ization of various disparate characters and concepts of mythology
It was basic. Bottom 3 marvel.
Worst movie EVERY, everyone associated with this movie should be banned from hollywood. Forget the fact that the storyline sucks the pace of the movie is slower than a snail!!
The story was rushed in a lot of places and I felt like it would have been better as a show with time to focus on things. It was more than a bit jumbled.
An expensive special effects movie without a good story.
The theater copy was not so clear as the iMax theater that I first saw it.
Enjoy the movie...awesome...
Great movie and plot! But was disappointed that Kingo did not participate in the war, irrespective who he sided by. Character depth was not to the fullest. Overall, good.
this has to be the one marvels movie that I almost fell asleep.
Over all good movie but plot and lines were too predictable.
The beginning of the movie was all over the place and hard to follow, and toward the middle of the movie it got much better. It was a good movie to go see, but definitely not the best Ive seen.
loved it... theirs two after credit scenes make sure you stay.
Good movie good action, good acting, beautiful scenes, and decent adventure. This movie might as well been a side story. Not a waste of time though, not good enough to watch a second time.
it was a new and fresh story for the MCU, and opened up many possibilities for the franchise!
Long.. lot of extra scenes that really weren&#39;t needed. Thank God Spiderman is coming in December.
Eternals had its moments of action, Marvel humor, and callbacks to other movies but there were too many characters, too much downtime, and unnecessary dialogue.
It was slow at times. Since I like superhero movies, I enjoyed it anyway. That being said, I&#39;d say I enjoyed Eternals the least of all Marvel movies thus far.
It has great special effects and the action was superb. Acting&#39;s a little iffy and it felt like, storyline, it&#39;s been done countless times before. Fight between Thena and Defiant was amazing. Angelina Jolie was graceful and liquid. 4*s because it&#39;s a MARVEL film and it&#39;s link to the other films to create a whole universe. 🙂
Inaccurate to comics but good overall plot. Good way to introduce the eternal to the avengers.
This movie was unnecessarily long &amp; disjointed. Very little character development. Many characters having no purpose at all, very few scenes and were insignificant. Many things not making sense. The story as it was being told in a long winded manner with no point at all. Screenplay clearly written by children and the entire movie thrown together. The imaging, action &amp; costuming were amazing. But the storyline, the dialogue, the way everything was presented was below novice, more like remedial.
I like the time travel aspect , and the focus on relationships from people who arent , or dont look like your immediate family . The eternals resemble a family of adopted children .
Eternals (no spoilers): I liked it. But I did have to shift my expectations as I got the hang of it. Like liking Welch&#39;s Strawberry Soda. If you&#39;re expecting strawberries, you&#39;ll be very disappointed. But if you taste it without expectations, it&#39;s enjoyable. Same for the movie. It was packing a lot into 2.5 hours. An ensemble cast. An ensemble of characters. An origin story. Giving enough hooks into each character for the audience to care about them. But moving the story along while doing so. It doesn&#39;t have as much action as some MCU movies. But neither did Thor, one of my favorites. There was lots of talking. Moments between characters. With an ensemble, so moment between multiple characters. It was funny and sad and had action and surprises and characters deeper than their screen time allowed. I liked it. And will watch it again. Which is more than I can say for Thor 2.
I don’t get excited about Marvel movies the way most people seem to, but I can certainly say the Eternals movie is far below the caliber of the Avengers films.
I liked all the back round on the eternals. Also the references to the Avengers I think they will be a good addition to the MCU The 2 post movie scenes were informative.. and made us come home and do some research.. lol
The storyline and plot twist is amazing. But ratings should have been Rated R. Sexual scenes are not suited for minors as well as some suggestive relationship scenarios are offensive to many.
In a word, confusing! Too much back and fourth which seemed to have no single goal.
so good but so long!
I enjoyed the movie, characters, development, original story line.
Likely will not bother watching it again. Most directions the plot went seemed to end without satisfaction or adequate meaning. Unlike most other MCU movies, it is difficult to describe the main points or purpose to anyone.
Ajak didnt put a fight at all shes supposed to be the leader and died quickly. You also dont see most of the Eternals and they really dont fight that much. They are supposed to be Eternal and they die that doesnt make sense.
Great movie. hope it&#39;s not too long before they come out with the second part.
Not a bad movie but not too good either, Chloe zhao is a great director in my opinion and couldve done a lot more if she was given a Disney+ show instead of a 2 hour movie that rushes character arcs and fits two plot lines into one with duct tape and gorilla glue.
too many characters and too slow moving. would have been better as a Disney+ show.
While it does explain who the eternals are for those of us who aren&#39;t comic book junkies, it feels like, &#34;just another movie&#34; and lacks the epic experience feeling of most MCU releases. It doesn&#39;t feel majestic. It feels more like a Disney + release. It was enjoyable.
One of the dumbest movies of 2021. What a waste of 2.5 hours.
I enjoyed watching the film in 3 d. The graphics were amazing. It was an interesting tie into past events. The storyline introduced the quality of each character. It will be interesting to see how they become one with other Marvel characters.
About an hour too long
Too long, but not really bad. Not great either.
Awesome Movie! Loved the new MCU story line and cant wait for the rest of the films.
Really liked it, definitely a unique set of characters and cadence to the film. I do love how it expanded the MCU in a new direction which should align well with other future films. Overall, I would say the Eternals was a big success!!
I love how the movie touched on each characters life on earth and how they become one in the end. The next one should be great!!
I really dont see what the problem is with how the story slowly developed, the movie was incredible, and if told any other way it would have been rushed. This isn&#39;t the best marvel movie but definitely not the worst.
good plot and compelling characters
It&#39;s a new beggining to the next wave of Marvel characters to come.
I didn&#39;t pay a 2 per ticket fee so you could spam me and ask me to make your site more popular. Every movie you spam me to rate, I will rate a 1/5. Suck it.
Great new way to Marvel!
I loved the story. I love watching Angelina Jolie. It made me jump a few times. I will watch again and again.
Big fan of Marvel and this totally disappoint me.
The story line and plot were rubbish.
This lovey in love ass movie sucked. The characters suck it wasnt funny, story was dumb, Ill never get that 2.5 hours back. Stupid movie.
Incredible special effects!
Sloooow! Uninteresting movie to me. It&#39;s way too long, the story line was weird and the action was lack luster! I wish I could get my money and time back lol
Very good movie. Nice plot too.
Really fun and action packed!
Fun movie, good action sequences
Awesome!!! There was nothing I didn&#39;t like about this movie!
Taking the MCA to new phase and a new level!
Nail bitting from the start. Some surprising twists and full of action.
Not a big fan of this one. Just a big letdown all around. Plot points that made no sense was the general theme.
Fun use of the Marvel storylines and other mythologies. Great visuals.
Enjoyable but falls into similar issues as other MCU films.
That was stupid, topped with boring, served over lame with a side of too long.
Absolutely beautiful. Different in many ways from other MCU movies but also familiar. I love the huge diverse cast and the time jumps. Worth the wait.
Entertaining movie with a lot of action
Long and confusing. Too many plot points to try to make one overarching storyline and the third act lacked any substance. No one asked for this movie.
If you like Marvel movies, it&#39;s a must watch.
Loved the movie, effects were great, good storyline. Overall, very much worth the hype.
story line took to long to get to the point and it was too convoluted with unnecessary flashback
No flow whatsoever. Felt like they were writing it as it was filmed
Great unique Marvel movie! Different from the rest but it tells a back story to help move the storyline forward. There is some twists to the movie! Great job Marvel!
it left me with so much questions, but I am so excited for phase four!
Impressive visuals, but the plot really falls flat. It is so loosely tied to The Avengers that they&#39;d have been better off not even calling out that correlation. Also, their &#34;super powers&#34; all boiled down to the same old tired thing. One shoots lasers out of his eyes, one out of his hands. One runs fast. One is quiet but is the most important person. I did love the diversity they put into this movie. Gotta learn some sign language for when Eternals 2 is released!
Definitely not the best Marvel movie but is 100% worth a watch! My daughter and myself enjoyed the movie and it sets up sooo much possible for the next phase of the Marvel universe. Just so you know there is 2 post credit scenes and the last is very important for the Marvel universe. #blackknight #Blade
Movie was full of diappointment hardly no villians crappy deviants which are special effect dinosaurs which sucks. Typical heroes shooting beams out their hands.
Great movie, awesome story telling, loved the ending. csnt wait till the next Marvel movie
It was slow at the beginning, eventually it moved faster once fighting began. I didnt like the Celestials as monsters, they couldve been human with super powers.
Great script, great acting, delightful humor, and i love the cast diversity!
Not what I expected from a marvel movie. Predictable plot and slow moving.
Why did marvel do this
Great movie. Great action.
This is a must see film!!! Love the action, romance, and comedy!!!
awesome movie, it is part of the Marvel seal.
A lot of violence but good story
Too long. Entertaining
I liked the way they developed the characters. Loved it.
marvel movie so it&#39;s always good
slow moving marvel film that lacked some of the humor and soul of what we&#39;ve come to expect from Marvel. Not to say i didn&#39;t enjoy it but i would rank it in the area of Thor 2 and the First Capt America. still worth a watch.
The most beautiful and deeply human Marvel film yet. Wonderful mythology and deeply felt humanity. I loved Eternals so much.
Story weak. Didn&#39;t appreciate promotion of questionable social issues. I go to the movies to get away from that stuff.
It kept one&#39;s interest. Good story.
Animation was awesome and storyline was captivating.
If I could give this zero stars, I would. Wow. Just pretend that star has been dipped in shit
Pretty good, super long though
I like the movie thought it was cool how they mix mythology into todays society
The movie was okay. It skipped around a lot and was hard to follow at times. This way plotting the events made the movie seem to drag along at times.
I didn&#39;t walk away hating this movie but didn&#39;t walk away loving it either. What was it? I am not sure. Maybe there was too much going on in one movie.
not my favorite marvel movie but definitely not the worst!!! you e got to pay attention the whole time or else you won’t understand what’s going on. some of the characters have confusing names so it’s hard to tell who’s who but overall enjoyable!
oh dear. I had expected much more from such a diverse and talented cast, but the movie started slow, stayed slow and ended glacial. Peppered into this slow moving mehburger were decent performances and some clever dialogue that stretched for a glimpse of the family theme that really could have worked, if I wasn&#39;t so, so bored. I prayed for the end credits to make the evening worthwhile.
It was pretty good, a little long though.
it was a good movie started off a little weird, but once you know what the plot is, it gets better.
I loved it! Open your minds to what’s going on in society! Great acting, great script, and a wonderful director = amazing Marvel movie!
Great story line. Wonderful acting. Striking visuals. Gemma Chan rocks!
I’ve seen most of the marvel movies, always excited to see the next one they come out with, but oh my is this movie bad, waste of 2 and a whole half hours, it was so bad I had to check my phone to see when it ends. This movie is as bland as eating healthy cereal with water. Words can not express how disappointing this movie is.
This movie was fantastic and the acting was very good!
so boring movie hate it.... not worth it
Story line could have been much better but entertaining. The cast is so strong, that helps.
The special effects are dope. The storyline was also very good. The characters are all interesting in their own ways. I would definitely watch a sequel.
loved it but too much back and forth. waiting for next one.
It was alright. I feel asleep during the middle
It was nice to see some connecting Marvel instances, but it still felt like its own fresh movie. I really enjoyed it and I look forward to the future of Marvel story lines coming from this movie.
SLOW &amp; way too long. I’m so disappointed in Marvel. Couldn’t keep up with good guy/bad guy. Or who loves who. What a waste of 3 hours of my life.
I enjoyed the story line with some history of who they are. I had never heard of the eternals. As a Avengers fan the tie in was interesting to me.
I loved the very human level of story telling that was represented in this movie. It wasn&#39;t all about the end of the world. It was about a group of people finding their humanity, and finding their place in the world. Truly a 10 out of 10
I honestly don&#39;t see why ppl or much more so critic&#39;s didn&#39;t like this movie, 3 secens fall alil falt just alil, the questions this movie makes you ask, how it tells a story and the small moments you can&#39;t really tell what&#39;s going happen its good not kinda good or even Sami okay, it&#39;s good sure it&#39;s not amazing but it&#39;s damn near close.
the move was too slow going and disorientating due to the back and forth timelines. the acting felt relatively ridged and lifeless.
We had no idea what to expect, but we enjoyed it.
It was good! Definitely see how it&#39;s been rated so low by critics, it&#39;s messy, the script is lackluster and awkward at times. Not technically perfect. Not for everyone. But in general, I think it succeeds at what it tries to do. Most creatively ambitious movie from Marvel Studios since the original Iron Man. Love the focus on character and drama, the atypical structure for Marvel. About time Marvel Studios comes out with something different from the typical Blockbuster action comedy formula. Hit or miss for sure. I say hit
Great intro to the next phase of Marvel movies. If you have followed the Marvel Universe at this point, then you like this one. Enjoy!
loved it! Marvel has done it again. great plot twists... once again earth and humanity was worth saving.
Wasn’t to good of a movie
It was a good movie.
Bad movie.. too much talking
expected more action. Overall it was an OKAY movie.
Pretty good overall. Not sure how the Deviants are going to play a role in the future movies. Seemed a little long for how much that happened, but it was a god start to a new saga.
I don&#39;t get the hate. Sure it&#39;s not 100% go go action explosions, and it takes it&#39;s time to develop characters and relationships and plot points, but that&#39;s exactly what makes it a _good movie_. Not just a good _superhero movie_, but a _good movie_ in general. It doesn&#39;t just tell you, it shows you. It lets you see and feel and grow with the characters, and the movie excels because of it. I can highly recommend Eternals, and for any MCU fan, it&#39;s essential watching.
I don’t even know what I just watched. Honestly more confused than when I walked into the movie.
Lots of fun and heartfelt at times.
The characters weren&#39;t as deep, conflicted, or interesting as some others in the MCU, but it was still enjoyable and entertaining overall, even if just mindlessly so.
This movie is slow moving and sucks.
💪🏽❤️acting , visual effects., drama, costume design , set decorations , directing and photography are amazing . A film with heart and tons of diversity ❤️❤️❤️❤️
great movie if you suspend whatever you know about the comic book...
It&#39;s a fresh Marvel movie and a must see for the next phase in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If you think you know how this story will be told think again! The most twist and turns I&#39;ve seen in a Marvel movie yet!
Casting was great but plot was muddled. Apparently toy, if you dont already know everything about the Eternals youre out of luck.
A little slow 🐌, but worthy of a watch.
A wonderfully human super hero story. The character development of the characters was superb. Helped to connect us to them and the story.
I never even finished reading the comic, and it was better than this movie
I liked the inclusivity and the twists
Slow almost fell asleep
Did not enjoy. Too many characters gets to follow. Not enough character development. Not enough action. Storyline difficult to follow.
much too long and dragged out. No need for Angelina Jolie or Selma Hayek. Anybody could have taken their place. But, the graphics were great.
To many characters were being introduced which I thought made the story line hard to follow.
it was a good movie that explains where the eternals are really on Earth for and the movie just looks amazing so If that&#39;s what your looking for then come and see this one
Not bad good build up for post credit
Very visually pleasing! The story is slow at times but all in all the action is very good and epic and the characters are fun to watch. Great marvel film!
This movie was kind of Biblical with tech thrown in. In other words, what is our purpose, are we really people or machines?
Sometimes difficult to follow story line. Acting ok. Lots of action.
overall a good movie. slow in some spots but otherwise a good movie to build a bigger MCU
Great movie! would recommend to anyone!
LOVE IT ALL CAN&#39;T WAIT FOR ETERNALS 2
Better than reviews say
I loved every minute of it.
I loved it so much, by far the best MCU film. Chloe Zhao not only pulls off intimate with epic but her casting was impeccable!! I can&#39;t wait to see it over again.
Absolutely phenomena a must watch if youre any type of Marvel/DC fan.
Lots of great CGI, but with typical sjw overtones...which defeats the purpose of going to the movies, to get away from reality! Lots of action but as a novice marvel reader, i felt lost regarding the story and characters, so it wasnt as engaging for me. Thankfully my son was able to explain things to me later.
I didnt think Marvel could make a worse move than Thor Dark World.but they did. Kept waiting for the story to pick up and be relevant but it never did.
Great visuals but somehow the storyline is too weak- you just don’t get invested enough in any of the characters.
In the @MarvelStudios Cinematic Universe — and just the world in general — more Kit Harington, please 🌹 🗡 🙏 #Eternals
Way too long and convoluted. There isn&#39;t even a hint of a conflict until the movie is 2/3 over and then it feels like it happens solely for an action set piece and nothing more.
loved the time table switchng back in time , and each Eternals special ablities.
Maeve does it again. Grand scope. Fascinating, diverse characters. A little too dense for young fans.
Okay movie but entirely too long. Scenes were drawn out and unnecessary. Good visuals though.
The new concept is very different I like the new way the movie was set up
It was good. I liked the designs of the costumes and the unique powers each Eternal had. The action was also pretty good, and I loved when they flashed back to each civilization they helped in. The Eternals are also really good characters with interesting personalities, except the two main ones, Sersi and Ikaris I thought were kinda bland. All in all, while not one of my favorite MCU movies, I had a good time seeing this one, and I can&#39;t wait to see what happens next with the end credit scenes.
The animation and acting was very good. The necessary character development did slow the movie down. It was anticipated...but still can be frustrating. The ultimate destination of the plot (movie) remains an unknown.
Didn&#39;t live up to the hype!
I loved this movie as it brought the marvels universe one step further into the new phase.
Loved the movie. I can’t figure out why these film critics are in a flux but I definitely fucs with this movie.
good movie, Marvel themed movies always have deep texture
The movie was not very exciting.
horrible writing and directing
Weak story with predictable punchlines to their jokes. The token connections to the rest of the MCU seemed forced as though they were added in as an afterthought.
Didnt like the story line. Hard to follow. Goofy in too many places.
Very detailed movie and full of exciting action features.
Not the most exciting offering from The MCU, but still looked great and had some fun moments. Shaving off about 40 minutes of bloat would have helped punch it up a bit. Worth a watch, but you&#39;ll only need it once, placing this at a still respectable bottom of The MCU films.
The movie was great. The ending is what killed it for me.
I really enjoyed this movie alot. Amazing cinematography, visual effects, drama and performances overall. I only had one or two small gripes about the film but other than that..solid motion picture indeed. I&#39;ve now seen the movie in theaters three times. It&#39;s one of the year&#39;s best films to me. Can&#39;t wait to own it on Blu-Ray DVD and online streaming.
Amazing film with gorgeous visuals. I only wish it were spilt into 2 parts to allow us to learn more about the characters but it was still exceptional regardless
What is that movie. O.M.G can wait for the next one
Good effects, poor storytelling, to long of a story.
a lot of talking. some action but very slow. you never are really sure who the bad guy is or what&#39;s going on
Worst Marvel Movie 🎬. It kept jumping from past to present and in between. All the characters were just whatever. They tried to bring in so many big names and their characters just fell flat. So disappointed. Don&#39;t waist your money.
While the plot was predictable, it was very entertaining with lots of action that moved fast and keeps your attention. Also like the bit of humor that was appropriately placed.
Thought it was great! For a large cast of new characters, they introduced them well and made viewers care about them. Strong storytelling, and Zhao shot it gorgeously.
Very good plot. Surprises through out the movie kelp audience engaged.
This movie is beautiful VFX. just Wow mind-blowing. Must see in theaters.
Loved that it had action and marvels has twists and turns, it started off kinda slow, but recovered in the end
Lauren Ridloff was fantastic but completely underutilized. Her representation is amazing but she rarely had any screen time. Angelina Jolie and Don Lee were both fantastic. The majority of the rest of the cast were just not great actors or didn’t have chemistry with each other. Editing was terrible and there were some really strange dialogue choices. Probably could have been a two star, but Kumail Nanjiani alone made this film drop down to one. His character and how he portrayed him was embarrassing, but it’s hard to tell if that’s his fault or the writers/director.
Very convoluted. Difficult to follow.
Loved the movie. Love marvel. Beautiful cinematography!
A wonderful story well written and acted to perfection. Despite being over 2 and a half hours, it was sprinkled with humor and action. I highly recommend you see this one in the theater.
Thought it was great! Hope theres another one!
It was terrible. They tried to do too much
I liked how they took the time to explained who The Eternals Characters came into existence and their place in the Marvel World.
Absolutely loved the whole movie from the storyline, the acting and cinematography all amazing!! Gemma Chan was my favorite but loved all of them! A great cast and cant wait to see more of the Eternals in the MCU!!
great graphics i guess. They should be since you see the same monsters were being fought the same way over and over. Why the hell was what i was thinking through out the movie and that was during the parts i could hear what they were saying. kind of dissappointed
It’s hard to explain but I won’t get that time of my life back a whole lot of nothing I just wanted it to end
Could have been a good movie but it jped around the timberline too much. I honestly didn&#39;t understand the story.
definitely a slow burn and really satisfying for MCU diehards. if you&#39;re familiar with MCU movies, come in with an open mind. if you&#39;re brand new, STAY AWAY. this is not a newbie friendly movie in terms of style and story.
Fun story, a twist and left more for next one
it has some missed opportunities in the beats of the story, some characters aren&#39;t fleshed out enough or discarded entirely. But, in the end i still loved the movie and I hope to see these characters again in the future.
Great addition to Marvel Universe and just loved the characters!!
Loved the movie! Hates Sprite
I wanted to like it, and it was okay. I just know that it was designed to set up other movies. So it is what it is.
I thought the film told a great story and it was a great set up to new characters and stories in the MCU. I would have loved a bit more back story on other characters but hopefully there will be a sequel to do that. The runtime is a bit long but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The chemistry of the characters and the beautiful cinematography are what really kept me watching. I would recommend watching this film.
Eternals was such a unique movie, it felt and looked like something weve never seen from Marvel before. The cinematography is incredible, the storyline is super interesting, and the acting is amazing. I definitely recommend people watch this!
Difficult to follow the plot line.
The new characters are interesting and make you care their own right.. will be even more interesting once they start mixing with the rest of the MCU.. If you like Super Hero Movies, you’ll like this movie.
I wasnt sure how I would like this movie, but it was good! Enjoyed the humor! Would definitely recommend! Marvel has done it again!
It feels like a fresh start in the MCU! Beautiful movie. I highly recommend it, and you dont have to see any other Marvel movies to understand this one.
Eternals is a nice, different entry into the MCU. There&#39;s plenty of new characters to learn about and a lot of backstory to tell, so it never feels boring. However, this is a long movie that does drag a bit because there&#39;s so much dialogue needed to explain everything. The Eternals were created to fight but they are to only fight Deviants. The CGI for the Deviants is very good and the fight scenes are fun, but the Deviants are barely in this 157-minute runtime, so there really isn&#39;t a lot of fighting going on. While they were fighting I couldn&#39;t help but wonder why some of the Eternals have lame abilities. I suppose that forces them to fight together because on their own there&#39;s only a few of the Eternals that can actually do anything to effectively hurt enemies. I also really wanted to see Angelina Jolie&#39;s character, Thena, kicking butt but she spent most of the film hiding. Knowing that Thanos is an Eternal makes me realize that whoever created him did a much better job than Airshem with these Eternals. This isn&#39;t a bad movie, but it&#39;s definitely one of the weaker superhero movies. Since I had no knowledge of these characters it was interesting to watch, but it won&#39;t be a film that I&#39;ll be revisiting.
lots of surprises. nice use of the cast of GOT
Epic and unpredictable!
Fun fantastical marvel movie Brian tyree green was perfection
Extremely well executed.
Too long with with a confusing narrative. Acting on the whole was good, but some characters were cloned ( re: Galactus and Superman).
Special FX &amp; CGI were Impressive!
Basically, this is a movie on an Avengers scale w/o the benefit of having had a few years of solo movies to introduce and develop the main characters. Consequently, the movie is a slow-burner, for the first half, with a great deal of flashbacks and exposition to set up the rest of the film. The characters do become more engaging, and the story more interesting as it goes on, but that is often hampered by dark (as in visually hard to see) scenes and CGI that looks more like something out of Shazam than the MCU. I think if you&#39;re a Marvel fan, and you don&#39;t have high expectations, you&#39;ll find the movie mildly entertaining, but it can be enjoyed just as much if you wait for it to be streaming, so I wouldn&#39;t recommend spending the price a movie tickets
Good movie. Lots of action.
It was a nice movie. Marvelous!
Liked the vast panorama, the plot twists and turns, the focus on characters rather than just super abilities.
Cinematography was very good. The story and acting was mediocre. Too much push for politically correctness in current pop culture issues. Not for kids. No purpose in showing a semi sexual scene and male gay relationship for a comic strip movie. The Eternals seemed more like duds and space less and immature creatures.
Too long. Needed a little editing.
Great movie. Sets up phase 4 nicely
Really long but enjoyable and excellent movie for any MCU fan
great graphics, good story, great acting.
took a long time to get to the Plot of the movie and by then the action part were few and far between.
I felt that Eternals was a good movie, but not a great one. Great actors, great computer graphics and cinematography. I found the plot a bit weak ... More Hollywood and less Marvel.
Another start of a great marvel series.
Loved it! Can&#39;t wait for the 2nd one.
We saw this movie in 3D and it was well worth it!! It felt like we were in the middle with The Eternals!!!
Its was drawn out and boring. I fell asleep twice.
Great Movie loved how it sets up Black Knight and possibly Blade?.
The pacing could of better I just wish the movie wasn’t so bloated with unnecessary status quo changes. Like just stick to the comics. But besides that it was good to see Angelina Jolie kick ass.
Good, but would have liked more detail in the backstories and more emotional urgency in them.
The theater seats we sat in were right under the projector which had a high pitched whine the whole movie. If I didn&#39;t want to see the movie that bad I would have left and got my money back! It was like listening to a dentist drill the whole movie.
The story and mythology was amazing! The characters were all amazing and had great backstory
I understand, though don&#39;t necessarily agree with, some of the criticisms but I thought it was a good time. Decent story with big implications, good characters, a couple surprises, and fun moments. Not the worst the MCU has offered, but if it&#39;s the worst Phase 4 and beyond have to offer then the future looks good.
A little slow but last half was good!
Good story and action. Kept my attention throughout
Story was slow and quite disappointing for a marvel movie
Eternals suffered a little bit from the barrels of exposition it needed to throw at you, but it was otherwise a worthy entry into the MCU. The diverse cast was particularly enjoyable, and literally every member of the team felt great in their respective roles. I adored Makkari, Phestus, and Kingo. Sure, Gemma Chan&#39;s Sersi was a great emotional core to the team, but the other three provided the sheer joy that made sitting through the expositiony bits worth it.
I enjoyed that very much so.
Did not enjoy at all. Very boring story plot and long drawn out movie for nothing.
not the best mcu movie, filled with long drug out dialogue but will make more sense after future mcu movie releases.
Excellent in every way. The ridiculous criticisms that is difficult to follow are nonsense. Great characters, plot, cinematography and soundtrack.
Marvel is back in theaters! This movie was worth going to the theaters! Major cliffhanger at the end !!
Long movie and seemed to be a little slow at times but visually nice and it gave good background for these characters. Have to be used to going back and forth with story lines but does its purpose
I was expecting better but the chemistry with the actors didn’t work well and there was way too much talking and not enough action
LOVED LOVED LOVED!!! A too. Packed definitely a must see!!!
a little to long with non action scenes
One of the best movies I have seen this year
Loved the movie, hate the ending.
It’s kind of slow in the beginning it took awhile to get into the movie but towards the end it picked up
Slower paced than your average MCU movie but it uses that time to build a much different and broader world. The story was a bit rocky, but the performances were able to turn that rocky performance and an enjoyable and unique MCU film.
Special effects are awesome - especially the parts with the deviants in them. It was a little hard to follow, though. I should have dusted off the old comics and read them before I saw the movie but I didn&#39;t. Be sure to stay for all of the after credits scenes as there are a few reveals there.
great film. great insight to the creation of the MCU. Great comedic scenes as well. Action was amazing.
I kinda liked the characters, it was nothing out of the ordinary... maybe because they had to give us the back ground on them. Their powers were pretty good they all had super strength but also had their own unique power.
Great addition to marvel Universe
Very different for the MCU. Could have been the best MCU film, but fell a little short in my opinion. The film is convoluted when it comes to the plot and cannot decide whether to present thought provoking questions about humanity or action and MCU humor. If the film committed to expanding the theme about why humanity was worth saving better throughout the film, then this could have been the MCU&#39;s epic Oscar winner, but instead it tries to do too much and can&#39;t decide what it wants to be. I liked the film a lot and would suggest it, but expect the wonderful themes of the movie to be convoluted and not fleshed out in a precise and thought provoking way, which makes the film semi devoid of emotion.
great movie. not sure why it&#39;s getting bad review so far. great cameo at the end!!!
Don’t believe the mis-hype! This was awesome!
Good action. Good characters. Kept my attention.
Why does Ikaris always look so monotone. Harry Styles brought this up a full star
It needed more story my dis likes my likes they all came together at the end especially the ones who wasn’t forced to come together..
Not all of the action of the other movies. Definitely liked it a lot. All kinds of setups for the future. Worth watching for sure.
Exciting and kept you guessing what would happen next.
It was too long winded. Story line was convoluted
The movie was too long, tried to do too much, and failed.
different but it sets up so many future stories for MCU.
Not being familiar with the original characters made the movie difficult to follow, other than that it is a good movie worth seeing. It takes awhile for the story to really get moving but once it does it takes you on a ride you won&#39;t soon forget. Some of the characters story lines could have been better explained and what their &#34;purpose&#34; or &#34;function&#34; as an ETERNAL is But in general it&#39;s a well made movie and worth seeing
Some incredible moments, but very long and disjointed.
This is one of the best looking Marvel movies out there, it&#39;s just gorgeous. I think the idea here is really cool. Some of the execution falls flat, partly due to there being just too much lore to set up for a single movie, so it takes a bit too long for the main story to move along, but I think the core ideas are great here, and I think there&#39;s a lot of potential for sequels here.
It was good - a little long or slow. Could have been about 30 mins less.
The entire movie was so woke. I go to the movies as an escape from the nonsense of the real world, but this entire move from start to finish was so distractingly woke.
It was fun, exciting , and such a plot twist! I definitely recommend it!
visually, it&#39;s beautiful. But very, very confusing. Too much bouncing from eras &amp; I did not care for the characters sometimes being good &amp; sometimes being bad.
The movie was okay. I didnt go into it with avengers expectations. The storyline was a little all over the place but I got the gist of it. What I did like was the Easter eggs throughout the movie. I may watch again once its streaming, to review anything Ive missed. I dont know if I can say that these characters deserve the same run as many of the MCU universe has had but theres potential there. I enjoyed the acting and the cast fit together well.
The story telling was really great. just enough action to keep it entertaining. Definitely left me wanting to see more of their story and what happens next.
The movie was sensational , can’t wait for part 2
#Eternals  in #IMAX was an epic, centuries spanning, action packed, emotional, surprising and visually gorgeous comic book movie 🤯 I genuinely don’t get the hate for this film 🤷🏻‍♂️ #MCU #ChloeZhao knocked it out of the park!
Beautiful movie ! Everything about it was more than excellent. The ending has me wondering wat will happen next I can’t wait.
Incredible movie! Great action sequences and superb acting and visuals. Chloe did an amazing job with this one! Looking forward to the next installment.
Funny, action packed, true Marvel style incorporating other Marvel Heroes…and cliffhangers!
very well written and casted! tugged at the heart strings a few times but definitely a marvel movie move!
solid origin story. sets up future movies nicely
They Gave Chloe Zhao a chance at this film! Bravo for introducing the characters and the story! Perhaps more Sci-Fi thrill than interpersonal drama... The Russo Brothers did an awesome job so maybe they can do the second Eternal moving?
Love it, great movie
Nice effects and great sound tracks!
I enjoyed this movie off the visuasl alone. I could have went without all the romance and love in the movie.
Not even one original story.
I loved the direction this Marvel movie took. I now have hope for the MCU again
The inclusivity was amazing. The actors were mostly already big names and made the movie great. I think it’ll help the MCU along really well.
Great Movie ! Took me a little while to gather the whole storyline but really enjoyed it !
Makkari was the saving grace of this movie.
A good epic for Marvel fans.
The 3d is gorgeous. A true must see.
great continuation of the marvel universe
Felt like Ikarus was Superman and there was a flash person too. Other than that pretty good movie. Plot was kinda confusing but all in all good
Good story with exciting finish
very interesting, not the typical save the plant show. very action packed movie
We have watched several of the Marvel movies. We thought this one was one of the more entertaining ones. We liked the storyline, and the special effects and sound supported it well. The characters were unexpected and added interest.
The film is confusing, too many characters, overly talky, and the Action Set Pieces were dull. Quick rule in films - if the critics talk endlessly about how diverse the cast is, that&#39;s to cover up a dull film.
just not a good movie. Lacked direction. it never felt like I knew where the movie wanted to take me. All Star Cast but the couldn&#39;t save this script and poor story development.
story was interesting but the connection to the avengers was lacking!!
Not to crazy about the fighting scene. Did not like Angelina part.
loved the storyline and how they kept true to the Marvel stories and timeline
Great action and a smooth storyline that entwined with the rest of the MCU very well
Great casting and very good story line. I was very impressing with the directing.
excelent, really good movie. I like the super héroes movie
It was a well written storyline. Plenty of action. The history timelines were placed well. Id see it again
I loved the worldbuilding that this movie gave. It is a little slow at times, but I loved the new characters and action the movie did give.
Not marvel type of move not worth the time or money
The characters lacked personality. Selma H. was not right for the roll she played. While there were established stars in the movie, there was no star power projected. There was good action but, nothing really captivating.
Great story line and special effects.
some of it was super corny, not believable. I was entertained however and its just a movie.
Wasnt the best mcu film but wasnt the worst found it interesting had me at hello but it was dull at moments
This movie more than likely will play an important role later down the line but as a stand alone film it lacks in entertainment value.
It was really kinda boring
It was OK. Would not watch again.
Richard Madden, lol. Nah seriously, it was a decent opener for the next phase of Marvel. It was no Blade or Iron Man, but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more and in store with the next slate of films. It was ALOT of story. I was also happy to see more diversity with the leads on screen.
another well written, well acted movie from MCU!
It was not as bad as people were making it out to be. Sure it could’ve been longer to flesh out character development. But I was still engaged in the movie although there’s more dialogue than I would like. Still find it entertaining and something to watch on a Sunday evening
terrible movie, very long, not really sure who the bad guy was, they were pretty much fighting each other. I&#39;m a huge Marvel fan, this movie was as bad as Green Lantern....
Awsome! movie with a great cast, and story.
There were some pacing issues, mostly due to the fact that it’s a story that spans thousands of years trying to fit in one movie, which is tough. Truly, it’s a sweeping epic based in a deep character study. The characters are all interesting and well rounded as people and their interactions and chemistry with one another really make the film as good as it is. And really, it is very good. I look forward to seeing what’s next for the Eternals!
Great movie Eternals. I like the world building and stories of past.
I like they start the action right away. the backstory was a bit elaborate but I enjoy the movie.
This was a solid movie with solid characters that successfully pushes the boundaries of the MCU for more characters and story lines to come. It had my full attention for the duration - largely due to the cinematography and characters. I could see it standing on it&#39;s own if you haven&#39;t watched any of the other MCU offerings.
Too long, great action!
The plot twists were fast and frequent. The action was the same.
I like the movie, it has great actors, wonderful effects, and besieging costumes.
I liked that it was action packed. It kept your interest. The story line was a little hard to follow ar times. But it was a good movie.
Loved the storyline completely
Boring with the uninteresting lead character I&#39;ve seen in a long time. The villain was terrible and the pacing was strange. Didn&#39;t like it at all.
Just ok. Wanted to leave in the middle of the movie, but couldnt because I was part of a group. Worth renting at home maybe.
Big swing into the bigger cosmic world of Marvel wasn’t as solid as I hoped it would be. The Loki series did it better, I think it was tough trying to fit so many characters into a film. It was still fun and it’s interesting to think where they’re going after this
its ok movie plot was disjointed movie had no real main Villain i wouldn&#39;t call the worst MCU movie
Great movie all the reviews that are bad is fake trust me. I’m a marvel fan who likes good action and a good story and this deserves a 5 star
It’s good and has a good cast. Some things feel a bit forced, but recommend giving it a watch
Boring and slow. Worst Marvel movie ever.
I loved the world building and it was a fin movie but if you look into it too much theres a lot wrong with the plot.
Special effects dynamic , storyline was unpredictable and misunderstanding.
The over all story was good. But it was missing the personalities that every other marvel movie and show has. Muted characters ultimately lead to the characters being forgettable.
Too many moving parts and dead spots. Not a good movie.
It was good. Alot of empty scenes it felt like with characters staring out in the distance but apart from that good.
The story telling was terrible the concept was great. I hope the follow up tells the story better.
Nice Visuals, cool action could have done with some of the extra dialogue that wasnt really relevant to the movie.
So so bad. If they cut out an hour of the boring stuff, maybe it would be two stars.
Not as bad as you’ve been led to believe.
I loved this movie. A great visual and break from the Avengers.
Very exciting and entertaining.....
They rushed the backstory and the connections that the Eternals had with each other. As a result, I didn&#39;t really feel anything for an of them
Ignore the critics this movie is worth the watch!
Different direction than most MCU films. not the greatest but the way it went deep into Marvel lore and included real history into the film as well was awesome to see on the big screen. cinematography was an A.
This was a great introduction to the next phase of the MCU stories. Played out a little slow, but overall very enjoyable and the first stepping stone to a more cosmic chapter of Marvel. Looking forward to how the upcoming stories weave together with this.
Loved it just like you were in the movie.
This was incredible from start to finish
While the cast was good, it really was lacking in direction. The timeline went back a forth too much. Dane Whitman should have been more prevalent. It was noted that some of the externals paired up however the only affection was shared by the male couple. It seemed forced and therefore underwhelming. There should have been more action scenes and it could have been about 30 minutes shorter. The film was CGI heavy and the deviants should have been less CGI and more prehistoric. Otherwise the characters were well thought out and the acting was good. It could have been so much better.
It was alright. Angelina Jolie didnt do much for the movie.
it was just ok. Sad to say I dozed off twice. 😴
It started out slow and then built up! I sure was glad! I was beginning to think I had wasted my money!
It&#39;s amazing, hope to have a part 2 of it.
a lot of back and forth with the time jumping and exposition. but itbwas a good movie. can tell it was made to set up a larger problem in the future
Took the family and we enjoyed it. I found myself entertained from the beginning to end. worth the watch in my opinion. I suggest watching it for yourself, some of these reviews are a little much.
I think it&#39;s a new starting point and too many folks expect it to pickup after end game and go on from there, but that story is over and this is a new story. Very nicely done.
I do not know why this movie is catching so much heat. It is far from the best Marvel movie, but the visual effects and acting are top notch. Would definitely watch this again.
The movie was entertaining and didn&#39;t take it&#39;s self too serious.
I didn’t even understand the storyline
Epic movie! Start to finish!
I loved the new story, new characters introduced into the MCU. I can&#39;t wait to see where this takes us.
Surprise surprise surprise!!!Indeed it’s not a “usual” MCU film and more like a fancy documentary that reveals the true Earth stories “by accident”. The story really blew me away so as the visual and sound effect. I was SOOO EXCITED to see this creative production to educate the public by coating with the form of entertainment — the true story of Annunakis!!!
I wanted to like it but it was the worst. I Like all actors individually but they had no chemistry whatsoever. Just wanted it to finish after the first 15 minutes.
Not enough character development
It was kind of all over the place plot wise. It didn&#39;t feel important to the MCU either. Very lackluster experience. Not bad, though. Just not good. XD
Too slow a set up, too long!
I thought the acting and story was awful. I actually left early because I couldn&#39;t take it anymore. Save your money and wait until it comes on TV. The worst Marvel Movie I have ever seen and I have seen them all!
Good story, enjoyed watching it.
A great introduction into these epic galactic characters that will open up the MCU to the vast Marvel galactic battles and challenges that have been in the pages of comic books for decades.
Eternals is a visual masterpiece! While the plot and run time can be drawn out and dull at time, the world building, actors, and action more then make up for it creating an extremely enjoyable and mesmerizing watch. Hopefully these actors and crew will return to continue the story!
Boring. Hard to get into it. I looked forward to bathroom breaks to get away from the movie. Dont waste your money
it is an absolute treasure and it is an amazing film i highly recommend seeing this film
I’m from Greenville, SC. and we planned a trip here to Panama City with my friends, we been wanted to watch the Eternals movie and we came to the Grand Theater we loved and hope to come back!
Wonderful graphics and action with a hint of the mystical. I wasn&#39;t familiar with the Eternals until the film.
Great details was awesome it had me guessing
I like everything about. Looking forward to 2 part
Not that great. One of the more overstuffed bloated Marvel entries. Disappointing
Amazing cast! Beautiful production and cinematography as always from a Marvel film. Twist and turns through the whole thing kept me on my toes and invested! So curious to see how this ties in to the whole scheme of the Marvel universe in this new phase.
The movie had to many flashbacks.Over loaded with computer effects. The sex scene and men kissing scene were not needed.Salma Hayek looked uninterested in the film.I wish I had skipped seeing this movie.
Long and drawn out. Threat was hard to believe after end game.
disappointed Marvel allowed this film to be shown to mess with people&#39;s beliefs.
well it finally happen... the Mighty Marvel Machine turned out it&#39;s first and (hopefully only) Stinkfest. If you can stay awake well, you&#39;re better than me. zzzzzzzzzzzz
Think this is definitely going to be a movie that you&#39;re either going to like or you won&#39;t. For those with passing or casual knowledge of Marvel stuff, you&#39;re going to get a LOT of new info dumped on you and it might actually take a couple of watches to get everything that&#39;s going on. That being said, it&#39;s still a decent movie that has a very different feel to previous MCU flicks. It&#39;s definitely a slower burn, which might be a bit boring to those used to much more action, though the movie definitely delivers on that front, too. If you haven&#39;t watched the previous Marvel movies, you can watch this without feeling you&#39;re missing out on a lot of information. Previous events are mentioned a few times, but the movie keeps its focus on these characters and the events relating to them. And yes, there&#39;s both a mid-credits scene as well as one after everything&#39;s wrapped up, if you&#39;re wondering about sticking around.
marvel does it again I wanted to know how they were going to approach celestials and it didn&#39;t disappoint
I really enjoyed this movie. can&#39;t wait to see it again
Terrible. The writing was awful. Felt like a DC movie.
Omg I know it’s a set up movie but it took forever to progress. Get it together marvel
Loved it‼️ Saw ETERNALS twice and enjoyed it both times. Marvel can&#39;t lose‼️ Next up, the biggest MCU movie to date: SPIDERMAN: NO WAY HOME‼️🕷🕸
Very fun story. Good character development. Awesome special effects!
lot of info to absorb!!! Really good movie
Very enjoyable mixed in with deep cosmic lore . No, of course the film has its many issues but you will have a great time in the theaters.
second half was good. There was so much to set up and it was handled kind of clumsily. But once they settled in it was good
This movie was great. The critics don&#39;t know what they are talking about!
This movie did what it is supposed to do...keep me entertained. Well done.
This movie should have been called &#34;Eternity&#34; because that is what it feels like sitting through 2.5 hours of this rubbish. We are now far removed from the good old days of 2012&#39;s Avengers.
Beautiful and wonderful move I enjoyed it! It’s been a while since a marvel movie made me cry but it was really lovely 🥰🥰🥰
I liked the acting and the storyline but the movie dragged. It was just too lkng.
The movie was amazing!
Not the best marvel entry, but definitely not the worst. Excellent casting and it opens up a new part of the marvel universe
too much filler in the middle, too many characters introduced at once... other than that, I loved it
I totally get what Thanos was trying to do now. Holy sh......
Great plot and amazing action sequences. It’s so refreshing to see such a diverse cast and such an interesting story. I definitely recommend watching this film.
Amazing movie. No giraffe which is sad. Looking foreword to one in the sequel.
Angelina Jolie slayed in this movie.
Loved the movie! Excellent cast. I loved everyone in their roles. Cant wait to see more of these characters going forward!
The movie had great graphics nothing we have not been exposed via Marvel comics. It required a steady memory alot of history and present day it difficult to keep up but I managed it.
Too much exposition and too little action. Probably the weakest marvel movie to date, and entirely skippable. The direction and pacing of this movie made it seem more like an action-drama series that should have been on Disney+ rather than a big screen title. There is little that the audience can use relate to the characters, and this may be the first marvel movie where I could not tell what the main characters were thinking of at any point. Not because they were complex characters, but because I could not tell by their facial expressions or actions what kind of emotions or thoughts were going through their mind, and many actions did not make sense.
Loved the Eternals!!! The backstory was good and cannot wait to see how they play into the multiverse.
Very slow moving story line.
Real good movie, but a bit long....
It was awesome, want to watch it again and can&#39;t wait for the next one.
I loved both the representation in the film &amp; the theological questions it begs the watcher to ask. It was action packed &amp; well acted!
I liked it. I love all marvel movies.
Slow action. Not like fast paced Avengers. Hoping second one will be much better.
It was way better than i thought it was going to be i loved it
Was very good but not great as it tried to cover too much in one movie.
It was a little by the numbers, the the fact that the series (Marvel) had been around long enough to have a “by the numbers category” is impressive in and of itself. I recommend it for the characters and the overall positive spin of the movie as well as the expanded world, MCUniversally speaking.
It was good. I just felt it was a lot of story line to follow.
Its a good movie, its a little slow, but that is expensive expected from a huge cast of brand new characters.
I’m glad I went but it was pretty slow paced.
A great movie that is a different style than previous MCU films. Adds more to the ever expanding universe, with great characters.
This was such a great movie! These characters felt fresh and seeing the dynamic between each personality and struggle was amazingly done! Marvel Fans will definitely enjoy! I already want to watch it again
Pacing of the movie inconsistent, story a bit convoluted
It was a great ride. Slow in some bits but a fantastic change of pace.
A good example as to where the critics got the review wrong. Great movie and good passage into continuing the Marvel storyline.
Didnt like the story.
This is not like the other marvel movies. it looked like to me they used DC comic weapons. the going back and forth in time you have to pay attention. its not as good as the brothers directing marvel but still a good movie but not great.
Really liked the story line and the scenery.
The movie kept you entangled. Awesome hope there is another .
On the worse end of the MCU movie spectrum, but still decent
Good not sure how it fits into the marvel universe
I like some of the action scenes of the movie but I didn&#39;t like how the characters were set up.
Visuals were great, plot and characters were half hearted.
boring no real adventure
Very slow for most of beginning, not impressed with most actors in it. I would wait to watch from home
Rating this is almost 2 different ways. As a stand alone movie I give it a 3. Too many characters… tough to follow at certain points. Took me entire movie to learn only half the names.. they spent a lot of time on social issues where it could have been to further build characters or further dive into storyline. BUT, I believe this movie needs to be viewed in the larger MCU sense. Future movies will build off this and in 5 years this will be viewed as an integral movie as part of stage 5 and will likely further improve with age. For the larger global view I give that a 5: to average as a 4 star film. It is a must see but may not get its true value for several years.
Long and for what, odd, often awkward, characters barely setup, felt overly dark. Worst out of Shiang chi, black widow. Glad I only paid $13
It was long with a lot of story but I enjoyed it.
Interesting plot twists, fantastic special effects and a little humor thrown in.
too much internal problems, and strife! superheroes shouldn&#39;t die right away! don&#39;t drop the other names for credibility!!!! make your own!!!!!
Loved the movie from start to finish with a stellar cast and a great storyline!!!
Too many characters w little story development. Felt disengaged
A bit slow and visually dark. Still enjoyed the beautiful images and acting.
It was a bit slow and not terribly interesting.
While I do have some critiques on the flim (like I would with any film), Chloé Zhao did an amazing job bringing this immortal band to life. Even though these beings are some of the most powerful in the Marvel Universe, they were more human than they could ever be. There was heart-break, betrayal, love, and family, elements that every great movie has. Each character was different from the next, and not just physically but emotionally. Not only did she bring such diversity that has never been seen before in a Marvel production, Zhao used the characters to bring self reflective questions to the audience that forced us to take a look at our society and take in all the things humans have done throughout our time on this planet. Hopefully she’s brought back soon to direct future MCU films.
Great film. However a lot of back story. Because its the first film there was a lot of backstory, a lot of fladhbacks, and it dragged at times. Otherwise a great film 4 stars
The diversity of the cast was excellent—all great actors. I was a little confused at first (but thats normal for me) but I would be interested in a sequel .
Very good plot line and characters played their parts well.
Interesting plot. Helps tie other Marvel movies together. Looking forward to the next one.
I liked it a lot more than I thought I was going to.
Parts of the movie gets a little boring and kinda hard to follow, but the action is great. Overall I really liked it.
What A Excellent Movie Loved The Story About This Movie
Fun movie! Good action sequences, character development and funny dialogue. Everything Im looking for in a Marvel movie.
It’s good and fun to watch. Good cast. But the storyline feels like several different storylines that at times get lost and feel disjointed.
It was okay it took me a little while to understand the story line.
I really quite enjoyed this movie! Is really different than the Marvel we are used to, yes, but it is great none the less! Each character was perfectly cast and its nice to see the different back stories for each of them. Im highly intrigued to see where the MCU goes with this. Ill be seeing it again!
Don’t listen to rotten tomatoes. And don’t expect a whole Avengers style movie. It’s a different take on the next phase of superheroes. Very well done. Also Karun is the leader of the Eternals. Can’t change my mind.
Expected more from a Marvel movie, ordinary scripts . A movie just to pass 2 hours and a half somewhere.
It was a good entry into Phase 4 of the MCU. There was a few parts that seemed to drag on a little longer than they needed to, but the acting, story line, action scenes, were all top notch &amp; amazing.
Overall it was good. A bit slow in parts, but the action scenes were exhilarating when they did happen. Some story elements didn’t make sense, but the characters felt like they were truly a family and the acting sold it.
I saw this movie in 4DX and honestly I wouldnt pay the price for what little it actually gave you. Not great.
Great story, cast and effects. It checked all the boxes!
The action sequences were good the story lacked however. Not the usual results from Marvel and Kevin Feige.
While the action sequences are good to look at which is what you expect from Marvel, this movie felt like a jumbled mess with no clear direction
If you want a slow, boring much of the time, woke movie about diversity and inclusion but short on anything else. this is your movie. Otherwise, skip it and go watch the Avenger series again.theyre much better. I wont watch another of these.
More nuanced and complicated than I expected and very well acted. Loved the broadening of the vision too
We enjoyed it. Lots of action scenes and plot twists.
Not good we left during 45 min of movie
The movie was action packed. The storyline was easy to follow. The special effects was excellent.
Slow moving, not sure about the story line and not a fan of men kissing and having kids.
Awesome movie. Was a great story line without constant mayhem like in most other Marvel Movies.
Surprisingly Refreshing. Enjoyed the story, some luxuries we&#39;re taken but overall very satisfying. Seeing the Celestials is cool. However, they are called the Eternals....death doesn&#39;t stop them...they get resurrected. Disappointed with only that aspect.
It was a great storyline snd loved the cast
Some parts of the movie were very dark &amp; hard to see. I was some what disappointed. Very long movie with a dragging &amp; scattered storyline. My daughter of age 13 lost interest about an hour in. The 4D effects were cool but at times Blurry. I would not recommend
Goofy storyline points and gaps in the story.
Loved it! Loved the story line can&#39;t wait for the next one!!!
I didn’t see it left because i needed my vaccin
great movie ignore the haters.
The action was spot on I love everything about the movie the story was well done. definitely worth seeing it again
Loved it. Very creative world/universe creation. Will lead to many different stories and arcs Im sure.
Great movie. Enjoyed the story. Good setup for what&#39;s to come.
Too many slow scenes, acting was mediocre
This movie had GRAND ambition. It was beautiful, exciting, moving, and even fun. There were some moments that were a little heavy-handed, but given the material, it was almost unavoidable. And as I felt after seeing Crazy Rich Asians, I wish Gemma Chang was my life partner.
It was amazing !!! Theres also two extra scenes towards the end. !!
Overall good but alittle longer than needed
Liked the story and the action
Wonderful and graceful film. Chloe did something very special. Hope to see more.
It was good to a certain point. There were parts that was just nonsense, unbelievable and ridiculous.
Boring movie, except for towards the end &amp; the whole entire experience was ruined thanks to a group of rowdy teens, who were nothing but loud &amp; obnoxious! A waste of time &amp; money overall. You go to the movies to have a good time, not ruin everyone else’s. I’ll try &amp; give this movie another chance in the comfort of my own home, without the disturbance of ignorant folk.
The movie was decent. I think that you would need to learn the origins of the characters to better understand the movie.
Made no sense! Hard to follow! Kept going back and forth in time!
This was a fantastic movie, a must see for any Marvel movie fanatic! The story was great, as well as the acting. I will definitely be watching it again!
Best movie of the year! So much action!
too long and all over the place
this didn&#39;t feel like a run of the mill Marvel movie but in a good way.
They did a Fantastic job connecting the movie, mixing cultures/ different lifestyles, and overall delivering the message can be catchy if you dont pay close attention but overall it was enjoyable to watch and worth to pay for.
Slow plot, bigger spaceships are not necessarily better.
Great movie. Would recommend
It was a bit different from other MCU movies but I thought it was awesome. Great action and a good story. It was cool to see how it tied into the MCU.
I thought the story expanded the Marvel Universe, like the Guardians of the Galaxy did and it is building upon the events of Endgame and Loki. The story was very well written, the cast was very diverse and extremely talented. It was definitely worth seeing and I look forward to watching it again to see all the things I missed the 1st time watching it. I
hard to understand story line. not enough excitement. not the best marvel movie.
Movie was so good pacing 9/10
Not your average Marvel film but overall it was very enjoyable. Some flashbacks can get a bit annoying but the story still follows through nicely. Definitely a good film for the family to enjoy.
Good but not great... still better than some of the lower tier MCU films. Probably could have been a bit shorter, but there are a lot of characters to cover. Overall very cool but I would have loved to have seen a bit more color overall... it was a bit of a dark movie for some reason. How it all fits into the grand Marvel plan is a mystery at the moment.
Amazing movie all the way through
Great movie! Very cool insightful. Like how it tied all the avengers and marvel heros. I like the message... I love the story line.
Good life lessons but too long
One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Horrible acting. Bad casting. Ridiculous story that bounced around all over the place. Forced situations that were more than obvious that they are trying to play to every single group of people. They also totally ripped off other super heroes. The main character was obviously a superman rip off. It was just so awful. Do not go see this. It is absolute garbage and the actors should be embarrassed their names are attached to this. 2 1/2 hours of my life I will never get back. Watching this movie made me fantasize that I was getting a root canal while being force to watch a donald tRump speech on repeat....the worst situation I could think of....which was still better than this movie.
I find it pretty boring… No real story, weak writing, and nothing really important showed up til the end…
Great introduction of Eternals, can’t wait for the next one.
The beginning dragged on and on, but after a bit of a rough start, an excellent finish! Visuals and special effects are absolutely mind blowing as you will love them!
The movie was great. It was a bit long. You could have shortened the movie a bit.
Knew Ikaris was the bad guy a mile away, and the main villain of the Eternals was in the movie but not the villain completely lost me there. But visuals were good and Thena was the favorite.
It’s the beginning of a new day. The universe has been cracked wide open…. ETERNALS FOREVER!
a feel good movie but nothing if you&#39;ve watched marvel movies. lacked uniqueness with quality and substance. extremely long for what it had to offer. it a time-pass sort of movie.
It was good. Not your typical Marvel movie but very interesting and good plot I thought.
Great action movie and loved the comedy but some of the plotline especially the ending had me confused. It was like Marvel - again - made a movie for its comic book fans that left the rest of us in the dark.
Worst Marvel movie!! So are they running out of ideas, and figured that it’d be a good idea to have a sex scene and two guys kissing? I guess I was dumb to think that marvel movies’ target audience are kids
I loved this movie. I’m already a big marvel superhero’s fan so I may be a little bias but putting all that aside, everything about this movie was well done. From the VFX, the sound design, the lighting, it was brilliant. The plot of the movie was cohesive and meshed nicely with the pacing at most parts, however some parts seems a little off imo. The characters when first introduced seemed weird, but once you spend some time with them they really become more fleshed out and understandable. The action scenes were phenomenal as usual and of course the comic relief was enjoyable. Overall an excellent movie and I can’t wait for the sequel!
Great plot and twists. Love friendship and love being powerful.
Awesome movie!! Must see
Can’t say it’s the best in the MCU but we definitely enjoyed it.
Easily my most disappointing experience in the MCU. Slow. Awkward. Felt little connection with any of the characters. Truly terrible offering from a franchise that is usually outstanding.
Never a dull moment in this movie
It was great movie awesome.
It was super good I like it
Fun and entertaining!
Slow slow slow. Feels like every thing in the movie was stolen from another character or movie. Plot was messy. Casting was terrible. Even Angelina couldn’t save this one. C-
Dragging in the beginning. Quite a few unanswered questions in the ending. But over all pretty good. Tip: stay till the VERY END of the credits for an extra surprise
Better than I expected!
Even though the movie was a bit long, I appreciated the set up of the history of the Eternals. I enjoyed the movie as did my husband and two teenage grandsons. We are all hopeful of a continuation with Kit Harrington’s character.
The premise of the story was attractive but that was the only good thing about this film. The plot was incoherent. The casting was fine but their interactions and decisions we at times inexplicable and forced. The climax was disappointing. By the end of the movie had no desire to see a sequel. Marvel was on a roll until this one.
Not my favorite Marvel movie. The plot was lacking and the movie seemed shallow. I wasn&#39;t expecting a lot so I wasn&#39;t terribly disappointed.
Real world issues on personal views of what is ethical right or wrong
A lil long but it was totally worth it. Marvel is doing there thing with next fase shit....
An absolute useless movie. The most &#34;Woke&#34; movie ever.... It was so over the top &#34;Woke&#34;, weird, useless content ! The movie ends and the entire audience was sitting, waiting for the next scene, it ended so Abruptly they could not believe that was it. Nor could I. There should be a refund for this. Flat Popcorn has more talent than this movie.
Too long, tedious Tried too hard to be inclusive of current political sub-groups
A lot of plot telling and not a lot of action
For anyone who likes the MCU I would recommend this movie. The graphics and cinematography were really well done along with the acting. The plot was action packed and the dialogue was interesting and at times humorous. There were some plot points I didn’t see coming and others that I think could have been more developed. All set us up for another movie. A solid 4.5/5
Way too long. Boring.
I was a slow beginning but the ending keeps you wanting more. Lots of action as expected.
It was just ok. It took much more from Neil Gaiman&#39;s Eternals than it did from Jack Kirby&#39;s original series, and i feel like it was a weaker effort because of it.
Interesting and entertaining
I liked the Thena character and some of the action scenes were great. I disliked every time the Sprite character opened her mouth, was in the scene, or remembering she was still in the film and had not died yet. Why couldnt be her instead of Ajak...
It was ok. It passed the time. Stunning visuals. If you asked me to tell you about it: I can not.
Good story. Visually outstanding. Saw it In 3D
good set up for things to come
Great special effects and use of their powers. A little long though.
This movie did not deliver on what I expected it to be. While I enjoyed the special effects, the plot, acting, and characters were hardly exciting, and at times quite boring. Also, I don&#39;t necessarily agree with same sex couples being intimate in PG movies. That is inappropriate for small children to see, regardless of who thinks otherwise. I will ensure I check this in the future before going back to the movies, I&#39;ll just spend my money elsewhere if this where big screen is going.
I appreciated it being different than all other marvel movies. However, I thought the sex scene was completely unnecessary, especially since kids watch these movies
It was ok. The movie drags a bit too much. They pretty much could&#39;ve cut out the first hour.
Too long and slow. It never ends. Awful.
Very good movie from beginning to end
Great movie, very unique from rest of the marvel catalogue. Love the visuals.
Loved the story lines, and the struggle between the value of human life versus, utilitarian ideas. Actors did an excellent job.
It was good but the movie felt long, not like other marvel movies, felt drawn out
We thoroughly enjoyed this movie and look forward to the possibilities of what to come 🤩🤩
Very entertaining with great characters!
A deviant from the typical marvel movies, love it
I didn’t enjoy it like I thought I would….It was boring and not action packed like I intended.
best movie ever!!! the ending is very suspicious enough on the edge.😀😀
I liked it...I don&#39;t know what all the negativity was about, but I enjoyed it...maybe because I&#39;m a lover and wear my heart on my sleeve and this was essentially like a love story in disguise.
Great Movie EXCEPT for the scene of two men kissing ! Totally not necessary to carry storyline!
This was my 3rd time seeing this movie and it gets better every time I watch it. I loved that marvel took a risk with this movie and it completely paid off is it different yes, is it still a marvel movie yes, it’s a popcorn kinda movie it has stunning special effects awesome set designs,great character chemistry,great story, and an amazing score. I don’t understand why some people don’t like this movie it just makes no sense to me as to why people don’t like this movie , I say to those people wake up and realize that it’s a different story and a risk taker and something that marvel wanted to do by introducing a brand new team of superhero’s. I give this movie a 100% and I extremely highly recommend this movie.
A slow start but seeing Shang-Chi just a day before helped fuel the mystery for what’s next.
Well done ensemble flick. Departure from the MCU norm but entertaining.
Pretty good decent. Easy to follow and all actors contribute effectively to this film. Very enjoyable.
A solid introduction to a previously unexplored realm of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
does not deserve any hate
This along with Shang Chi are introducing new elements that incorporate deeper aspects of the Marvel comics and beyond superficial hero characters. It does decent in explaining the back story but it also raises more questions, in a good way. Must watch in IMAX‼️
Kinda slow in the beginning but after that it was pretty good.
Great move, back ground helped but could have been less.
The movie was good but not great. Its also about 25-30 min too long. Still worth the price if admission. Wasnt Marvels best effort but still better than most things in the theater.
Terrible!!!!! Slowest movie I can remember watching. Great premise, too much sappy dialogue. Marvel needs to erase this one from the Universe.
I loved the new integration of the new MCU heroes. It was the perfect balance of action. The way the characters were depicted, showed the good and the bad in each of them which was refreshing. I will say that I would have liked for the ending of the movie to have been more of the focus than the initial parts where (SPOILERS) the eternals fight the deviants. The beginning fights with the deviants made it seem much harder than when the eternals had to face their biggest challenges around the end. Overall great movie full of great representation!
Could have left out the semi-sex scene, men kissing, and religious innuendoes. Marvel, stop trying to please every group out there and just write a cool superhero movie.
Fun on the big screen. Storyline a bit grandiose but his setup for future films.
Just lacked in everything.
Being the fan still didn&#39;t feel excited at any part or scene in the movie. The cliffhanger at the end is alright. Yet, not reached my expectations. Waste of big names for this movie. I always didn&#39;t like this story of celestial birth from the planets. This doesn&#39;t feel like Sci-Fi at any level compared other MCU movies there are logic and reasoning behind those movies which more convincing and realistic than this movie. Don&#39;t think I will rewatch this movie again.
This seemed to be a stretch for new content in the Marvel universe. Entertaining, but not outstanding at all. The main reason I went was Angelina Jolie had a key role.
Slow. Confusing. Not according to comic book origin story line.
That was the worst Marvel movie of all time.
terrible movie, easily the worst marvel movie ever made, one of the worse movies ever made period.......
It was amazing, the story line right on point! graphics were mesmerizing, so many paths for new movies on the marvel multiverse
Exactly what We needed after the last Avengers
Boring. Silly. Didnt capture our attention whatsoever.!
The movie was horrible. I’m surprised because Marvel movies are usually really good.
Another great Marvel movie that I&#39;m sure will continue to give more answers to many MCU questions.
enjoyed every minute of it
Besides being very long and drawn out, the plot was very confusing. It was a struggle to determine whether the actions of the Eternals in the end were good or bad.
Amazing movie, awesome characters and I love the cast. The ending was awesome too!
I liked that it was like Star Wars in the Beginning and words explained what the movie was about . I dislike that it ended so quickly like Dune Part One Movie. My youngest 15 year old son loved it. It was a lot better than Halloween Killings Movie.
Understand it is an origin story, but really slow and long to develop. And the development was not worth it. No tie to the characters, and pretty unamazing battle scenes. yawn. Would not recommend. We love Marvel, but this was a stinker.
I love everything Marvel
Always nice to go see a marvel film.
This movie is actually a good movie to watch. I don&#39;t understand why the critics didn&#39;t like the movie but it was very enjoyable.
I felt the plot was drawn out. It could have been about a two hour movie.
Felt like a setup for multiple films to come will see again. Thumbs up!!!
It’s a little slow at times but the action seens are really good.
Decent movie. Very dialogue heavy. Some of the relationship plot points didnt make much sense to me. However. The concepts and side plots were interesting, and Kumail is funny in the role.
Great actors. Poor script. Man kissing man, not my cup of tea.
Just saw it in 3D/4DX and it was incoherent. Could not hear the dialog. I think there was a story there somewhere. Good thing there were at least some satisfying landscape shots to pass the time.
Great movie in the next phase of the MCU. While I was concerned with how Marvel would ever follow the Avengers movies, this was a great movie to keep things going!
Awsome! Can’t wait for more
The characters weren’t well developed but the action sequences were very good.
Exciting with great special effects. I loved it. Looking forward to the next Eternals movie. PS: I am 74.
New introductions or origin stories are always difficult to do. Marvel did a great job with this oneeasy to follow and interesting. Ties into the MCU at the end very well!!
movie was longer than expected but it makes sense considering how much plot and setting up for later movies. Overall it was very attention grabbing. Twist and plot lines that I didnt see coming. I would recommend for those who are marvel cinematic fans or those who are looking to get more into the universe. how ever it shouldnt be the first one, movie, that you watch.
Just okay. Dares to try to be something different from the rest of the MCU, and the talent is there, but the story and screenplay are inconsistent and it&#39;s just tough to care about the characters if you don&#39;t already know the source material. Okay to wait until it&#39;s available on streaming.
Nothing ground breaking a few plot points were disappointing but the acting and action were great and set up a lot
Just thought the movie was ok
A bit long but very exciting and action packed. Lots of surprises and twists!
Too many flashbacks. Too many useless locations. Too many gotcha moments in place of good writing. Casting chemistry lacking. Marvel’s worst outing by far.
good movie, but odd for the mcu.
For a Marvel movie, it was pretty weak when it came to action.
The diversity was nice. Action is good and I liked how they tie in the rest of the MCU. The only thing that bothers me is the fact that the life as we know it is threatened as it is, however, not one Avenger (there are some left) ever shows up to help. That is a bit unrealistic to me. Overall, a very enjoyable movie.
it was pretty great!
It&#39;s awesome preface to whats to come going forward. The action is good and story is dense however it&#39;s impactful.
I am so in for the auditory equality and superhero motif change up! Thank you so much, I LOVE that!! But….Harry Styles? I didn’t go through a One Direction phase so…I hope his addition in the second installment will be great. All in all, I’d see it again and would let my niece’s and nephew see it too. The ideal superhero is evolving and I’m so in for it. :)
a little slow at parts but a good story.
Great story line and set up for phase 4 but it was a 2.5 hr movie with little action
I thought it was a little slow in the beginning but that changed for the better
I loved it will lead into sevrale movies and life that.
Beautiful, ambitious movie. A lot of characters to introduce and a bit slow at times but honestly a nice change up from the Marvel fare we are used to. Sets up a lot of possibilities for the future
Movie was awesome! Would recommend people see it I&#39;d theyblove the marvel universe
Okay so first of all pretty boring until like maybe last half hour but then got my attention but like Harry styles?? THANOS brother?? Likee huh also them a part of cinematic timeline,,, ehhh i just don’t want them to ruin the whole concept
Such a beautiful film.
Two many threads too focus on the good ones enough.
The cinematography was good. I liked the characterizations. Overall though the movie slogged in parts. Movie was lacking in humor. The sex scene completely unnecessary. Overall it’s the first MCU movie I don’t feel like watching again. The two externals that showed up in after credits were more interesting than the main characters.
HORRRRRENDOUS. Don’t waste your money! If this is how Marvel is going to be now, then I will never watch another Marvel movie. So disappointed.
I really really love that movie it was so awesome thank you for showing it at your movie theaters
Finally a superhero movie that moves a pace that isn&#39;t frantic and with a story line that is easy to follow. Loved everything about and stayed engaged even though it is long! Go see it!
Very dysfunctional family
I thought it was great , it didn&#39;t drag the story kept on going , no clue what the critics were talking about .
Yet another addition to the marvel universe, but is it one really needed? I enjoyed the legend of the 10 rings better, and had no expectations going in to see either. There&#39;s a doom and gloom feel to this movie that even the humorous parts can&#39;t shake. Not bad overall, but not a great movie either.
Marvel has run out of material and the movie could not figure out if it was supposed to be a comedy or an action film.
It was entertaining and worth watching but it didn&#39;t stand out as one of the better movies in the franchise.
The movie was terrible. Long way off from other marvel movies. It had choppy transitions and the plot could have been better. Too many dead end story lines. The one positive Ill give is that The fighting scenes were great.
Excellent action/CG. Storyline/plot-llne weak. Poor character development. Too many holes in the story. Kunail Nanjiani and Harish Patel interplay was the most fun and enjoyable thing about the movie.
I really like the Eternals a different Versions of any kind of marvel movie love the story time I thought that was great. characters and love between them and the hate to. I am looking forward to see them in Phase 4 and 5. I Love The Movie
OK, but, far too politically correct &amp; woke. nice CG work, graphics OK, but really, too much PC stuff, pandering to political crap. Won&#39;t watch it again.
i like the movie...It kept me guessing, the action was good. the acting was great...I don&#39;t know what there was not to like. the only thing that bugged me was that the movie starts off saying they&#39;re immortal...and clearly they&#39;re not
Lots of action, good plot twist!
The movie is different from what marvel often puts out but is still really fun
Great Marvel movie, special effects. But way toooo long.
The movie lack substance in the story. Nothing held it together. For celestials creations they were week and lacking.
not bad but not good either
The visuals are really cool but I honestly did not relate, nor care about any of the characters. Additionally, the plot was fairly predictable and dull. To me the best part of the film were the two end credit scenes which makes me hopeful the sequel will be better as well as the teased Dark Knight project.
We loved it. An adult Disney Marvel movie. The characters were great as the story progressed. Themes of Love and Life&#39;s challenges are woven into a science fiction movie. Really enjoyable and relaxing. The action was awesome with scary monsters and great effects.
While there was a lot of action and some amazing special effects, the plot was weak and hard to follow. Some things werent explained and a few things made no sense. I love Marvel and DC movies. This was the worse one Ive seen. Its just ok, did not keep my attention. My 15 year old grandson spent part of the time on his phone which Ive never seen him do at a movie.
It was too long and the constant going back in time and coming forward was too much. I was able to follow the story, but my teenage daughter couldn&#39;t. It was work.
Excellent origin story with interesting themes on life.
Loved the cinematography and all of the characters. Amazing movie and makes me excited for the future
It was good but not really fantastic. like I thought it would be.
I expected a difference experience from the movie after reading about the actors and characters and how they interacted. Not as excited after knowing it was a Marvel movie,
This movies leaves leaves you with more questions than answers. May be better to watch at home.
I’m a big fan of Marvel but the series, Eternals, never captured my interest and I even found it confusing to understand. Not so with this latest MCU film! I not only understand what the Eternals are and how they fit in the MCU, I really loved them and their story! I don’t want to spoil anything but I will say that Marvel has begun to show the incredible scope that storytelling is going to encompass as we go forward in Phase 4. I will say, I was very happy with all of the characters, but Kingo was my favorite thanks to the writing and portrayal by Kumail Nanjiani.
This movie open up the Marvel Universe. The plot was not great but movie was very enjoyable. it was long but people needed to know who the Eternals were since you would not know who they are unless you read the comics.
It was a lot of fun and had lots of action to keep the whole familys attention
The movie was great with some twists you wouldn&#39;t expect. It lays the foundation of what Marvel has planned, so it does spend some time building up the characters. If you do watch this, make sure to stay after the credits for BOTH scenes.
I did not like the fact one of the main and powerful character who was the leader was immediately killed off and did not put up a fight with the member who betrayed her. Many members of the team were killed off during an introductory story
Meh. It was alright. Too long. I fell asleep a few times.
It was a bit too long and needed more action. The cast was great!
Marvel should have stopped at End game.
Expectations does have its impact, after hearing some negative reviews I went in with lowered expectations and found it to enjoyable.
There was too much &#34;back story.&#34; Also, it was a little hookie at times. Marvel movies usually skip the sex scenes and &#34;enough already&#34; of show casing the same sex couples along side of heterosexual couples to prove we stand for diversity. It&#39;s a film about super heroes.
Horribly long for no reason. Long and windy storyline that didnt make sense. On the flip side, great visual effects and action scenes (although there were only a few good ones).
Eternals was aptly named ... it felt like an eternity.
Great movie. could&#39;ve been little shorter.
Lacked &#34;Marvelness&#34; Forced myself to sit through all the hamfisted plot and dialogue which should have been cut to let the really neat fighting sequences shine through.
Worst Marvel movie ever.
After the bad reviews I went with low expectations, but I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected! Marvel didn&#39;t disappoint, once again!
I like the aspects of the movies that were different and that were firsts but I do feel like there were misses with the pacing and the tone in the first half of the movie. It doesn’t really pick up and become the movie it had the potential to fully be until the Eternals start to rebel.
Some light humor like other marvel films. There were a lot of character arcs to maintain, but they did a good job with that. Its still one of the first films in this next phase so of course it will feel different than other Marvel movies. Still enjoyed it despite people trying to review bomb it.
Great storyline, looking forward to future films of Eternals!
huge fan of Marvel and this was a breath of fresh air different in a good way and opening up huge possibilities
Characters were bad. This movie was just boring! We left halfway through.
too busy, didn&#39;t care for characters. Sprite was awful
Great story, amazing casting, super cool visual affects.
Great action and special effects.
Loved everything. Movie was exquisite 199/10. Wouldve been 1000/10 but I didnt like the way I was teased with harry only having like 10 lines.. his angelic presence made it better though.
I left halfway through the movie. It was mind numbing. Zero star power and no definitive plot. The powers of the externals were weak and confusing. The time jumps and fist meetings with ashram ( I think ) you could Not make out where they were. Just not a good movie. I want my money back.
This movie was so disconnected, and slow. The plot twists are decent, but this really didn&#39;t have the feel of the Marvel films we&#39;ve come to love and expect. The end just left me questioning my life choices about buying my ticket.
The movie was fast paced and held your attention
Honestly, it was okay. Not great, but not bad either. Definitely a different kind of MCU movie, but definitely a slower-paced movie with the usual Marvel moments we expect. I had moments in the movie where I forgot it was Marvel. I think the real complaint I have is how they tried a bit too hard to make the Eternals and their lore “present” in everything that’s happened in the MCU (and history), but “not really.” That, and the amount of “teases” for the future. Both are done at an obnoxious levels here.
Bad Marvel Movie...we did not need a sex scene. What&#39;s more is the Movie was just all over the place. Marvel really got it wrong this time. Huge thumbs down 👎🏾.
Different pacing for a marvel movie which felt refreshing. The villain was forgettable and didn’t seem to have much depth. Chemistry between characters was the best part about this movie. Overall great movie underrated.
Nice concept and storyline but the deviants weren&#39;t developed enough
Kinda slow and the ending was anti climatic
No idea what is going on here or how it relates. This was a long drawn out excursion into nothingness. And then randomly at the end oh, jon snow is the new black knight lame.
It wasn&#39;t as bad as I feared but it certainly wasn&#39;t great. Nothing like the source material. Angelina Jolie was terrible and completely out of place in this film. Icarus was turned into a lame version of DC&#39;s Superman. They even mentioned it in the film. I suppose to make sure the audience noticed. It did have good effects. The story wasn&#39;t good. No more than 2 1/2 stars out of 5 from me.
Excellent visuals and great way to kick off another phase of the Marvel universe.
It was ok not the beat from Marvel&#39;s but ok
It was a great introduction of characters
Movie is way too slow and should have never been made. This was a far reach even for marvel. Save your 2.5 hours and do something productive instead.
I slept through the whole thing
Holy smokes I&#39;d rather have my eyes bleached for 2 hours and 37 minutes than watch this movie again.
Beautiful visuals with any amazing cast that portrayed the characters as they should! Great story line and I can not wait to see more of them!
slow ... do not recommend
Very interesting movie!!! Loved the actors .. classic marvel movie.
It was delightful to watch a different kind of Marvel movie.
I wasn&#39;t expecting a love scene in a marvel movie. It was too long and the story line was hard to follow. Even with prior knowledge of the eternals.
Unfortunately, not a great plot and even some great actors couldn’t save this movie. Definitely not the MCU.
Lacked a little Marvel charm but told a good story with great action. Clearly set up future MCU movies. Much excitement throughout the theater with the first post-credit scene
I dont know why the critics were so harsh. I really enjoyed it!
I loved the characters and I can’t wait to see more of them in the future. Post credit scenes were amazing, overall I really enjoyed this movie!
This film dares to challenge the tired MCU&#39;s formulaic machine and achieves something great and innovative for Marvel. Truly a cinematic triumph!
Good but not great movie. Good setup for the MCU but a lot of exposition...
Kinda seemed to drag out, but seems like its gonna be important for the marvel series.
FANTASTIC special effects, great humor, action, story line &amp; character development
Really good movie, loved the visuals, endearing characters. One thing is the length might seem scary but it honestly feels like it should have been longer. I know it will come with time but I loved some of the more supporting character and wished they got more time to shine!
The movie was amazing just didn’t expect the sec scene
Being a new addition to the Marvel Universe they include the typical getting to know the characters before the plot really gets going. After that, it&#39;s non stop action and if you&#39;re paying attention can follow the plot fairly easily.
I really liked the movie. The store line and all the action. But it really lost my interest when they had the gay couple. But other then that it was good.
I honestly think this was a really great movie, I&#39;m happy that I didn&#39;t know what to expect and I love that there are so many recognizable stars in it. They did a superb job, I definitely want to watch this again. It&#39;s full of the right amount of storytelling and action. I was never once confused about what was happening. I so look forward to what&#39;s next of this cast and story.
Waste of time. Terrible plot the story just dragged on and on.
marvel is really starting to suck bad and please stop preaching about social issues I go to movies to escape
It&#39;s Marvel, the story masters. What&#39;s not to like? Can&#39;t wait to see where all the breadcrumbs lead in the future!
Did not care for partial nudity or two men kissing. Had to cover my kids eyes. Didnt feel like a Marvel movie.
I gave it one star because I couldn’t give it 0 stars
Much better than I was led to believe by Rotten Tomatoes Yes, it was a massive story crammed into 2.5 hours, and it would have probably been better served as a Disney+ miniseries. But if youve been complaining for Marvel to do something different, there is The Eternals
It was good, but the beginning was hard to get through !
decadent movie. feel like it kind of runs into the marvel problem of kind of wasting their villain, but enjoyable overall
A bit long, but a fun sci-fi premise. Lots of interesting characters and it looks beautiful.
Great story telling. Score was fantastic.
boring from start to finish and a disappointment for a marvel film. And of course marvel has caved to the LGBTQ agenda and had to factor that in with emphasis this time. ugh
it was pretty good i enjoyed it not sure how it ties into the mcu yet though
Really great intro to a new series for Marvel! Very excited to see how they go further.
Great visuals but that’s where it ended for me . The characters had no depth , clunky awkward interactions , terrible lines &amp; no chemistry . There were about 10 mins of decent story telling before it descended into a mind numbing predictable cliche. If you are going to watch it , watch it in the theaters or just pass.
Pretty chill but at the same time action packed. So nice to see a cast with many people of color who don&#39;t play stereotypes. Def will try to see again
The most boring Marvel movie I have ever seen, with limited action scenes. Kumail saved the movie with his humor. Inappropriate love scenes for young children, so be aware.
great action, nice story
Weak story. Action was decent, but I could have waited for video.
Action packed! Go see on the big screen!! It’s a MUST!
Amazing movie with great balance. A wonderfully talented group of professionals with perfect diversity. I will continue to support this movie and love the story line! YES! A Win!
I think this was a great example of storytelling and laying a foundation for the newest phase of the MCU. Getting to feel the impact of The Snap and have it talked about was satisfying. Definitely wish we got more time with a few characters, but the ones we did get to be with, I learned to both love and in one case, loathe. And seeing so much representation where we haven&#39;t so far in the MCU was also truly awesome. Really enjoyed ☺
Great action. Poor storytelling and I’m a comic book all star.
Great sentiment about family! it&#39;s less about super heroes than first a family relationship film and what that means with the weight of the obligation of being a super-hero layered on top. cinematography is top notch and its such a relief to see real on location shooting in a marvel film.
I was thoroughly disappointed and Im a SERIOUS Marvel super fan!
Story was interesting but too long.
slow but worth it. I cant wait to see the remaining cast fleshed out. maybe come back in Avengers 5 or 6
lot of story telling, but it adds to the Marvel mythos nicely
Liked the story all though at times it was hard to follow Thena&#39;s problem.
Writing wasnt as strong, but still enjoyable.
loved it &amp; watched till the very end.
Great cast , special effects . Great story telling
I really enjoyed it. Eternals is not your typical MCU movie, but it adds wonderfully to the universe! Great story, great action scenes, and character development!
Array of characters, played by excellent actors. Intricate plot lines, well woven. Action and pace. Didn’t feel like 2 1/2 hours.
It was one of the worst marvel movies I’ve ever seen. The story jumped around a lot, and felt like a step back compared to what we’re used to seeing in an MCU film. It could’ve been shorter, cutting out some of the dull moments in the middle of the film. The beginning and end were decent, but I found myself wanting to leave the theater a few times due to a lack of interest. There were a lot of cheesy moments that could’ve been completely avoided, that contributed nothing to character plot or backstory. The film may have gone a little too crazy with the amount of characters they brought in. It works for avengers films, but not having an attachment to these characters made it difficult to get into. Overall: just save your money and listen to a YouTuber explain what happens for 20 minutes, because I felt like I wasted $20 and 2 1/2 hours of my time.
Love it! It started to drag for a minute but pick right up and finish with a Bang!
I enjoyed the storyline and characters. I also liked the big stars. Wasn&#39;t familiar with the Eternals. Nice introduction.
overall great movie - although there are some very unnecessary scenes that are not suitable for children
Excellent, very entertaining and a very fast tempo.
I really enjoyed this movie! The action and visuals were stunning, and I did enjoy the cast of characters a lot. I like that Marvel is branching out more into stranger and more unique stories. This movie may not be for you, but if you&#39;re a Marvel fan, I&#39;d urge you to give it a try!
Very nice special effects. But ... dialog, script and directing was not up to par IMO. Found myself hoping the end of the movie would hurry up and get here.
it was slow and long and draggy
Movie had its flaws but overall succeeds in giving a coherent and straight story.. between funny and beautiful cinematography.. enjoyed it a lot
I heard all the complaints.....sex scene...too much going on...the usual. First off Iron man 1 had sex scene....so who cares. The movie was very well done, is it the best MCU movie...no...but it does open up a lot of future plot points and brings an even more diverse flair to the MCU.
Incredible story with elaborate character/world building, 10/10, couldnt take my eyes off the screen, would watch again, so great.
A more thoughtful movie than any other MCU movie. It was self aware enough to make meta comic book jokes but never to the point it was silly. Profound exploration of a metaphysical debate.
Didn&#39;t like that Salma Hayek was killed off.
I liked the interesting story. I can&#39;t wait to see the next Eternals movie.
Too long. Too dramatic. Not a typical marvel movie.
I&#39;m not a comic book fan, so I don&#39;t know if The Eternals was a series like the other Marvel stories. If it is,... Then the 1 st story was entertaining. Unless the rest of the series is more exciting, and un expected .. this would be disappointing. From all the fantastic material available in the Marvel Universe, ... that&#39;s already been written and proven successful, I&#39;m sure there is better material out there, to turn into Block Buster worthy movies.
Solid entertainment overall. I didn&#39;t find it to be great or excellent, but, it wasn&#39;t bad either. I think we go through these spells of these superhero universe movies and it saturates the market. At some point they always become underwhelming to me. It may be time for another break from them. Acting was good, some cheesy parts, some were funny. No serious complaints.
Rotten Tomatoes critics&#39; opinion of movies are about as useless as having air conditioning in the arctic. That being said - Eternals was a great movie. It was different than your typical Marvel flick. Great action sequences, great character relations, and a great story. For the people who complain about dialogue, I believe there is another Fast and Furious movie coming out for you.
Slow, not much action
Beautiful use of natural light. Very slow character development. Not in love with the Celestial or Deviant designs. I don&#39;t think any of the Eternals were engaging enough to really have me get excited about the actual team. More of a Superhero soap opera.
This movie turned out better then I expected. I had low expectations, so for me, it was worth seeing.
Storyline was complicated
Daring and Ambitious. The most adult MCU movie yet. It does have some flaws but I forgave them in light of how thought provoking, complex and visually striking the movie is.
it&#39;s was pretty good not the best marvel movie but I liked it.
overall it was an enjoyable movie, but it was very slow. also there were a few scenes that I wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable with the younger members of my family seeing.
Bland. Lazy writing. The actors lines were delivered unconvincingly. Im fully vested in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, however, I couldnt wait till this movie was over.
A little slow. A couple of scenes that made my family feel uncomfortable. Easily could have done without.
The unexpected betrayal by Ikaris and Druig being the &#39;good guy&#39; so different from the comics. The appearance of the Celestials especially the awesome ending where Sersi transforms one. Pip and Starfox also.
great entry into the MCU.
plot can stand alone outside of marvel. casting was fantastic and very inclusive. special effects were spot on
Good as a Sci-Fi movie. It lays the groundwork for multiple Marvel projects. it introduced a lot of characters that may be new to the casual viewer which may hard to follow.
It felt more like a romantic drama. Too much talking. Not enough action for a marvel movie. Most movies nowadays are very blunt about political agendas and I have given used to it. With that being said, I absolutely disliked having the 12 year old girl “being in love” with a 40 year old man. Is that the beginning of pushing for making pedophilia acceptable? Other than that, there were good parts and interesting timeline.
It felt off if I’m comparing it to other marble movies, definitely was a different vibe that I got, too much cgi
Horrible movie they just talk for 3 hours
Won&#39;t recommend or rewatch. I watched it because it is a Marvel movie
Great movie. I would watch it again. Thanks!!!
To me, I really enjoyed how we see Sersi become her own person and put her foot down as the new leader of the Eternals. Definitely would watch again if I get the chance.
My 22 year old daughter and I absolutely loved this very different Marvel movie. I so enjoyed it. I laughed loudly and cried too! This movie was exceptional! I can’t wait for the follow up movie! Go see this movie you won’t regret it!!!
honestly loved it , the sound effects were great and the visuals were amazing, and all the characters were likable
loved it the cast was great. The style was different from other marvel movies I loved that. a
The story was extremely poorly laid out and made no sense... Save your money and wait till it comes our on local TV..
It was really long and dragged on some parts. It also had an intimate scene that did not have to be in a marvel movie that kids are going to watch. By far my least favorite marvel movie.
One of the worst of the MCU movies. Between the incessantly long face closeups, mediocre acting, lack of leadership in superheroes who couldn&#39;t think or make decisions (this movie really needed Batman as the leader), and filler scenes that added nothing to the story...I was tortured for a lengthy movie that even bathroom breaks couldn&#39;t keep me from yawning and nodding. It gets 2 stars for the better than average CGI and non-superhero actors that elevated it from one star. This movie was an MCU mess that had potential, yet failed in so many ways.
Fun, beautiful, great time.
The whole movie was a hot mess.. Not a fan of the new and not improved Marvel
It was ok took awhile to get going
The movie itself was good, not the best of Marvel movies but not bad overall! We liked it and actually look forward to the next one!
Something felt off while watching the movie. For a movie that is over two hours it felt like it was rushed. Some parts didn’t seem like they belong or were out of place.
It was good, but predictable.
Action packed! Enjoyed the entire movie, including the two extra scenes at the end!
No real character development and dragged on and on.
I enjoyed the movie, it felt different than the typical marvel blueprint. The whole movie almost felt separate from the marvel universe at times. I found it hard to connect with the characters at times though, and there were some things that felt rushed or could have been a bigger part of the story that weren’t. By the end it made sense why everything had to happen the way it did, but i definitely would like to see how these characters will interact with the marvel universe in the future.
Loved the action and story line was interesting. Didn’t like that they made Icarus the bad guy and kill himself at the end.
Weak characters. No one had heart to fight. No one had loyalty to each other. Weak fight scenes. The more notable and likable characters like Gilgamesh and Athena had no screen time and were wasted off. Love story blows and alot of wasted screentime.
this movie was the best I&#39;ve seen.
No character development.
The Eternals was a damn good movie I encourage all fans to check it out.
An otherwise mediocre film was completely ruined by the sudden front and center closeup of the two gay male characters kissing. It was sufficient enough that the audience gets the point when one refers to the other as his husband but that scene was unnecessarily repulsive and caused us to get up and walk out. Marvel will not see another dime of my money until they change their ways. The heterosexual scene earlier between Serci and Icarus was equally unnecessary and could have been deleted so that all preferences could enjoy the movie equally, but no, that’s not enough. Bye bye Marvel.
Loved it! Extremely diverse cast and a great story (as far as superhero movies go). I do not know where all the hate is coming from.
Alright superhero movie that provides entertainment and mostly great visuals. It seems Marvel didn&#39;t learn from DC&#39;s failures, who introduced too many characters and &#34;epic&#34; themes in a single movie. Not terrible, but had potential if they focused on fewer characters and a narrower theme.
Great action, great job on back stories, superb special effects... Phase four is looking fantastic
There is nothing to dislike about it, my only complaint is that the Deviants weren’t utilized as much, but overall I still give 5 out of 5 stars, loved it!!!
Marvel movie, so of course it was good. There was a lot of jumping around regarding the historical timeline. A lot of it could have been cut OR make the movie a two-part movie.
Not a movie for kids. this movie was not good at all. I like how it tried to explain the celestial story. movie is painfully long and full of useless story line going no where... could have been a better movie
There were twists and turns that I had not expected from the start of the movie. It was an emotional rollercoaster, but one worth going on!
not good, very limited action. seemed to drag on and on. easily in the bottom 3 marvel movies, maybe bottom 2
It’s a beautiful film with a long overdue diverse cast of great actors. Had plenty of funny beats but for the most part played like a family drama framed in beautiful colors and cinematic direction. I loved Gilgamesh and his relationship with Thena. A love and devotion as natural as they come,
very entertaining 👏 laughed a lot... great movie.
The middle was long.
The story line was good. But it dragged on and could’ve been shortened.
LOVED IT will watch it over and over
This movie was terrible. It kept going back and forth to explain the back story, very slow. My husband kept saying it will get better, give it some more time. We left an hour before it ended. I am being generous giving it 1 star and that is only for the 2 fight scenes that were decent.
You could remove at least 30 minutes from the film if not more. Also, sex scenes in a Marvel movie? Really?
Its a great movie. Its a different story than the usual Marvel Avengers and leads in to a completely new story and if you watch the Easter eggs at the end and post credits, there are two, you see new characters introduced. I disagree with Rotten Tomatoes. This movie is great.
Complicated pre story.
Way better than I expected. Loved everything about it.
La trama es buena. Nos remonta al tiempo de la primera civilizacin humana y como los eternals tratan de ayudarnos dndonos un poco de conocimiento en tecnologa que desafortunadamente los seres humanos siempre terminamos utilizando esas herramientas para nuestra propia autodestruccin. La vida de los Eternals es aburrida enfocadas en un solo objetivo que es ayudar a el nacimiento de un nuevo creador de galaxias que nace de un planeta al azar necesitando la destruccin del mismo para poder existir. La traicin de Ikaris no me agrad. Pero lo por an fue su arrepentimiento y su propio suicidio, fue tan estpida la manera de aceptar su error. Al final de la pelcula el nuevo personaje que aparece en forma &#34;animada&#34; (un fauno creo yo) es el peor CGI. Parece que regresaron a las animaciones de Van helsing tan falso que hubiera sido ms creble que utilizaran un animatronix. Pue al final estuvo bien para pasar el rato.
Not as bad as the reviews would make it sound like. But definitely not a home run either.
Very deep dive into the cosmic Marvel Universe, but poorly executed with lackluster storytelling. Guardians of the Galaxy did a fantastic job of introducing the audience to the cosmic MCU, but Eternals fails to deliver where GOTG succeeded. Also, where the Infinity Saga films focused largely on the story itself and may have commented on some social issues more organically, the MCU appears to be injecting social commentary with a much less natural feel, and frankly in some cases feels forced. I hope the MCU can get back to more entertainment-based storytelling with less social commentary, and if issues are included, let the story progress around it naturally. I enjoyed the MCU as an escape from reality and a dive into fantasy. I can easily be reminded of the wrongs of the world by turning on the network news.
Marvel again gives you lots of great graphics and a decent story line. This movie sets you up for another group of heroes to help save earth! Good character development but slower than other Marvel movies since it’s developing characters.
Epic world bending sci if fun
Usual fun Marvel movie.
Not realistic. Jesus lives
There were some surprises, some heart and some laughs. It could&#39;ve been better but not as bad as people made it out to be. Gilgamesh and Thena, Druig and Makkari... These couples ended up outshining the main couple. That&#39;s all I&#39;ll say about that.
Although Salma Hayek was under used... My main attraction was Gemma Chan. She did a great job. The CGI was great and action scenes were what you expect from Marvel. I fully believe this will hold up other Marvel movies coming up. So yes it is a must see.
Tried to do too much too fast with a storyline that strained believability, even for an MCU entry.
Silly plot didn’t make sense. Poor superhero’s not marvel quality. Don’t waste your money!
Awful movie. Worst Marvel movie Ive ever seen. Wasnt worth my time or money. It should be removed from Marvel. It doesnt play a part at all in any of the other Marvel movies. If it didnt exist, it wouldnt change anything. Awful.
it was better than the reviews for sure
Great cast of characters, and well directed! The action sequences were well choreographed, and overall a very interesting story. I&#39;m excited to see what comes next!
loooooooved it! This movie had so many twists and turns and the post credit scene was everything!!!😍
Could have been a little shorter, but great movie!
Long and boring. The actors did a great job pretending they didn’t have emotions, but that’s not a good concept for a 2+ hr action movie. Definitely didn’t stick around for ANY of the credits/spoilers.
I never thought I&#39;d walk out of a Marvel movie.
Great action, beautiful cinematography, phenomenal acting and a worthwhile story. Another great addition to the MCU.
The worst marvel movie ever. Very little action. A unnecessary sex scene between eternals don’t waste your time and money.
The movie was interesting
Yet another exciting and humourous Marvel adventure. A couple of surprises, and really awesome action
The plot took a while to develop, there were a few twists that were unexpected, and special effects did not disappoint. Over all, I enjoyed Eternals and am looking forward to seeing where Marvel goes with this franchise.
It was a great movie with a meaning of life inside of it that most people didn’t understand.
I love the Marvel moviesbut this was probably my least favorite. I was a bit underwhelmed, just see,Ed a bit flat.
It was a really good movie. The only problem was that there was too many characters to focus on. I sort of got this MCU version of Watchmen with this movie. Overall, it was good.
Great story and character building. The cinematography is amazing! Marvel did not disappoint!!
This was a beautiful and moving film. While you know it’s in the MCU, it doesn’t feel like a Marvel movie. Beautifully shot, great score and Angelina Jolie is incredible. Everyone was great.
Entertaining movie. New Marvel story line.
enjoyed it tremendously. the movie was humorous, thought provoking, entertaining and slightly unrealistic. Its about superheros and not a documentary. Loved the graphics. A good installment in the Marvel Universal. Would like a sequel Looking forward to seeing where this new direction will take old and new cameras.
It was a good movie. Good battle seen. Actors/Actresses did a good job with the characters. I just think after the movie they could have done a better job Introducing the two characters. No one really knew who they were and they werent that interesting.
Great movie. A little long, but kept my attention.
The pacing of this movie was very slow and the plot was too predictable. They put too many characters in this movie, I felt like they could have saved some for a sequel. For me it doesn&#39;t have any rewarch value.
Awesome new look to the MCU
Loved the character reveal and development of all of the characters. Complex plot was easy to follow too. minus 1/2 star for the sex scene - really not necessary to the story at all and a surprise that level of intimacy is not in other Marvel movies.
I loved it, I messed up on last review. I meant to say there was nothing I disliked. It was amazing from beginning to end
The movie was tremendous. Entertaining from beginning to end. My problem is it left me wanting to know more. To see what happens next.
It was ok. It wasn&#39;t bad. It wasn&#39;t great. It wasn&#39;t super compelling. For example, I had to use the restroom half way through and didn&#39;t feel like I was missing anything.
Good movie, however, at times it seemed to drag on. I also didnt like how the movie kept going back and forth.
Very good. Don’t believe what people say. This was a good movie.
Boring lack of action
Love everything about the movie I will refer a lot of people to watch it
It was alright, enjoyed the fights, but was terrible in many places keeping the viewer engaged.
First of all it took 30 minutes for the movie to even start. Too many commercials and previews. The movie was slow. It was good but way over hyped.
I did not like it at all. I thought they were grasping at straws to tell a story and it was like watching a long episode of the power rangers.
To much talking too politically correct . Dividing people . And to focused on marvel fan . Im a marvel fan
It was a different kind of movie not like the traditional MCU superhero movies. I wasn&#39;t quite sure what to expect, but it was excellent. The writing and the acting. Particularly Richard Madden, and a different view on a hero with Jolie&#39;s character Thena.
Great film if you’re immersed in the MCU and are looking ahead for more, leaves Amit waiting for what is to come.
boring and slow. Very hard to stay awake
My father cant stay awake past any 80 minute movie. He stayed fully awake and was genuinely laughing and enjoying himself. He was wide awake all through even the end credit scenes. Amazing movie , highest seal of approval in my family.
To much backstory not enough action. Plus characters were very forgettable.
So....this movie wasn&#39;t horrible. However it&#39;s not in my top ten for Marvel. It stands on its own as a good solid origin story for the Eternals. Unfortunately I felt like I was watching a DC flick. it was more serious, unless they made mention to Thanos, Cap or Avengers, this movie didn&#39;t even feel like a Marvel film. That being said, I look forward to what direction this sets up the rest of this phase with Marvel.
The film was very confusing to me still dont understand a lot of it
DOPE!! Can’t wait for the next one!!
Great movie! Action packed.
The story never made me care about the characters. So the subsequent events never had the emotional impact the director was aiming for. Marvel can&#39;t make every movie a blockbuster. They proved that with this one.
Clearly the ending is leading on to a Eternals 2. Can’t wait!!!!!! Awesome movie. Definitely recommend.
Rating this movie as I sit in the the theater......Boring 😴
Nice job of blending pre-historic mythologies, Greek legends, hindu &amp; Christian religions. Thought-provoking as well as entertaining.
I enjoyed how different this is from a typical Marvel movie. I’m thankful that no one spoiled the major surprises, too.
Has some pacing issues but very enjoyable, top 10 MCU films to me. Unique characters portrayed by great actors, looking forward to a sequel
I LOVED the cast and complex marvel deep driven story line, with beautiful scenes throughout this whole movie I was intrigued and anticipating what’s going to happen next. Can not wait for future movies.
Movie was good but not great. Just not into the whole new Game of Thrones phase Marvel is taking us into.
The visuals &amp; relationships between the principal characters was awesome
Characters not developed. The movie tried to engage us in history events and good deeds, but missed. The Oscar god was ridiculous. The actors did their best, but it didnt matter. The creatures they were fighting were unbelievable. We could go on, but we would rather forget we watched it. Sorry to say it was a thumbs down experience.
To put a long story short, plot holes make the movie less and less enjoyable. The forced romance into the plot and representation of multi culture and the small segment of LGBT represented makes it feel as if this is less of a Hero movie and more of a political correct cash grab. It&#39;s clear this movie was rushed and took no time to do a proper representation of the comics. The ending will make you scratch your head and the sheer lack of action in what should of been hero story will leave you baffled. TL:DR forced romance, lack of action, severe plot holes, deaths that don&#39;t add to the story. if you are looking for a movie to pass the time this will do the job, however if you are looking for a representation of one of your favorite childhood comics, steer far away.
Great movie. Hopefully they can make more Eternals movies.
Overall I enjoyed the movie. There were a number of moments that didnt work for me. The character Sprite didnt feel fully formed. Also true for the Black character who invents tech. I know the cast was large and the movie couldnt develop each one, but those two played significant roles, so the loss was noticeable. There were also a few moments where the scenes just didnt generate the excitement I think the director was aiming for. I very much liked how she moved away from the typical good guys vs bad guys theme and had The ETERNALS struggle with this. An enjoyable film, even at 2 1/2 hours!
Incoherent , lots and lots of plot holes, and other issues
This was a great introductory movie to a much older and universe spanning part of the MCU. The characters are complex and diverse in their motivations and characteristics. The plot of the movie unfolds well layer by layer with foreshadowing being rewarded with answers. At the same time all the characters are only in the beginning of their journey/character arc. While the story presented in Eternals is a complete story, it sets up so many more questions about the larger MCU and what the consequences of this film means for the characters here and for the wider MCU. It is not my favorite MCU movie, but it is an essential stepping stone to bigger and greater storytelling in the future.
Far to long. Far to esoteric.
weakest Marvel movie I&#39;ve seen in a minute.
My one complaint was the constant jumps in time period, you had to keep full attention to when/where you were. For example one scene may go from 350 BC to present day to 7 days ago. Other than that would definitely recommend
Lots of action. Exciting.
Very good movie with a diverse cast!! One of the most diverse Marvel movies Ive seen thus far
It was ok, I really liked the creatures and fight scenes.
Everything about this movie shines, it&#39;s just different than a typical MCU film. If you&#39;re looking for an action blockbuster, this isn&#39;t it. BUT. If you&#39;re looking for a gorgeous movie with a lot of great narrative backstory to the MCU and earth, this most definitely IS it. for the few action sequences there are, those are great and beautiful.
Too long of a lead in, but was a pretty good flick
This new philosophy of Marvel&#39;s universe is very interesting. Perhaps this first delivery is just more explanation and history I am looking forward to the sequels so we can grasp and enjoy more. Amazing special effects and sound...and the cast is luxurious.. I loved this movie
Movie was good just not Marvel good.
It was long but I did like it &amp; my grandson who is 14 thought it was great!!!
Eternals is pretty good overall, but I feel it is kind of crowded with the amount of heroes and antagonists in the movie. They could of done better with less or split it up into two parts.
Really enjoyable movie, but alot crammed into one film. Still a great showing
Love the whole movie ❣️‼️💯
Hot doodoo. A series would’ve been better
Its a lot different then your normal Marvel film. While it does have bits of humor the film is a lot more serious then most MCU films. Its also slower then other comic book films with alit of flashbacks showing events from the past.
So disappointed in this movie. The potential was wasted. Horrible character development, horrible accents, flat jokes and poor storytelling. I can’t believe this was green lighted as is.
not a bad movie by viewing standards but if you like marvel comics lore it feels flat. the movie had a confusing but fun plot but the family dynamic of the movie seems just shoved in. so many unanswered questions.
Out of all the Marvel movies I’ve seen, this is the first one to disappoint :/….there were a couple of scenes that weren’t necessary or got dragged on way to long. This movie had a lot going on. Too many different points to follow….but nonetheless it’s Marvel! I had to see it. The humor was good :) and Angelina Jolie definitely helped this movie succeed even though she didn’t have that many parts.
The story was very confusing and to long..
Awesome movie non stop action and laughs screw what rotten tomatoes things
great cgi and effects, good casting and humor along with an easy to swallow story for a great movie.
Too long, lack action and compelling story!
Good fresh new movie to introduce new heroes into the MCU. Stunning visual effects, amazing cinematography, the music scores were amazing as well. I’d watch it twice
Its a marvel movie. Theyre the best
Its a fresh new story and well handled by MCU. Its big , something exceptional to be seen in future.. Thena was the best of all. Kingo s funny. And evryone did so well.
DONT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS! IT WAS AMAZING!!! I don’t understand where all the negative hype is coming from? It was beautifully filmed and told, it had heart and was thought provoking. I thought it did an amazing job of explaining the larger celestial aspects of the movie and reconciling how the Eternals existed all this time. I think there was great chemistry between Gemma Chan and James Madden. There were great quiet moments and more than enough action to make it worth seeing on the big screen. It also had just enough Marvel humor. I sure hope they make another Eternals film!!! And lastly the director did a wonderful job. I think in a less auteur’s hand it could have ended up being cheesy as well less face it the Celestials are a bit out there. Def go see in the movie theatre!
Real dumb. Cant believe they had to have a team breakup scene during the destruction of Tenochtitlan by the conquistadors. Feels bad. Would&#39;ve given one star if not for the sex scene... Haven&#39;t seen that much sex in a marvel movie since the first Iron Man.
MCU has another Great 1!
Was pretty good. Some scenes I could have done without, all of the intimate scenes &amp; sex scene....they didn&#39;t need. Was moving kind of slow in the beginning but could see the story came together finally in the end. Loved the diversity in this Marvel movie.
I loved the story line and the inclusion of history and mythology! I enjoyed all the characters.
Disappointed not much action, movie dragged and way too long.
I loved the visual scope of it - Stunning! We also enjoyed the story and the incredible timelines.
Sooo as someone who heard NOTHING but how horrible Eternals was…I really wonder what happened to the people who felt this way AFTER seeing this movie. Hands down, one of the BEST superhero movies ….ever. So deeply conceived to explore many universal themes….This all tied together by the ripples of consequences and the fruit love bears in our lives. Well Done.
I love it a lot to tell but every part of it was interesting, loved the action and comedy
Excellent set up for the future of Marvel, with beautiful visuals and great casting. looking forward to more!
A fantastic experience with extremely lovable characters. Breaks away from the Marvel formula in a fabulous manner. Will be seeing many times again!
Marvel did something very different here, and some people won&#39;t like it. Its not the same Marvel formula, and that is exactly why I like it. Very Beautiful and Powerful Movie
As any marvel movies goes they add in a bit of a comedy which I personally like. The movie is worth the watch in my opinion
This movie was a serious introduction of The Eternals to the general MCU audience. if there is another outing of this character group, a little more humor and individual backstory would make them more appealing.
It was different than what I expected. But a good different. Story and actors were good.
A must see, exciting and thrilling
Taking into consideration that this movie was created to introduce the eternals, I found the plot and final scene to be lackluster. Regardless of having high profile actors casted in major roles, the overall plot seemed disconnected and underwhelming. Not even the two after credit scenes could save this movie.
OMG!!!!! HARRY STYLES!!!!
It was good to get back in the theater to see movies, a good movie to forget the news!
First, credit to the cast for quite enjoyable acting. The overarcing plot was interesting, however subplots were incredibly flawed and character arcs were non-existent. The film was beautifully directed, and designs and set pieces were magnificent. Unfortunately, this brilliance was muted by the unhurried pace and disconcerting flashbacks. Somewhere between the screenplay writers&#39; floor and the editing hard drive lies the perfect Eternals film. Valiant effort, with an incredibly difficult group to depict cinematically. Unfortunately, Marvel fell short of the mark.
I was expecting more. Salmas character died at the beginning of the movie and I would have liked to see her in more action.
Better than expected. Not your typical marvel feature but I loved it regardless
Great action. Little to long down scene
It was really just awesome! Visually stunning and super interesting! I loved it.
amazing graphics and story, the diversity is wonderful
Great movie love action and plot
too long and story line not good enough
Very nice cinematography but really convoluted story and characters.
First of all, this movie was so beautiful to just look at. There was so much action and the plot was so fun to follow.
Good story. Beautifully shot
Visually it was a good movie and what you would expect from Marvel but.....the whole premise had them stealing from every religion and taking credit for every advancement on planet earth. They actually quoted the bible...as if they came up with it. It really was such a hodgepodge of religions and mythology that it was distracting and the story wasn&#39;t that good. Also, there&#39;s a pretty prolonged lovemaking scene (thrusting and noises included) that was uncomfortable to watch with my teenager :( Gay marriage and a gay kiss were also featured. I would argue that they broke a cardinal rule of great sci-fi movies that while love can be explored any sexuality never is. Hero&#39;s don&#39;t stop in the middle of being heroes to have a shag because they are doing what they are doing unselfishly...well, not anymore I guess. Save it for 5 tuesday.
great movie really good fighting sequences
The most epic of Marvel origin films. I look forward to their next adventure, individually or as a group. Angelina Jolie was incredible! Give Thena her own movie!
It’s long anti-climatic. People were so bored they were taking out their phones in the theater. Graphics are great and they definitely hit the mark on biracial. Kumail is the best character and it was fun to see John Snow.
Worst Marvel movie since Disney took over. Tragically disappointed.
Good first introduction to the Eternals
Liked the action of Angeline Jolie in the film. Disliked not really enough action and the past and present day storyline makes you have to pay attention.
I thought the movie was good but you really had to pay attention to the back and forth between decades and centuries. There was humor and lots of action. Hey, it&#39;s a Marvel movie!
worst movie since captain marvel. got some things right but ultimately the ending was just horrible. the movie needs to be retconned. pretend it never happened and move on.
Enjoyable and thought provoking movie, that I would see again. I loved all the Easter eggs and the multiple storylines it opens up. It’s very ambitious in scope with the world building and number of characters introduced. However it suffers from so many questions about what’s next and the minimized threat of the Deviants.
Great action packed movie can&#39;t wait to see the second release because their will be one for sure
4 of us went to see . Ages 14 , 16 , 52 and 66 . We all thought that it didn&#39;t live up to our expectations. The show seemed to just kind of repeat itself as it went on. Was just OK for us.
A whole new part of the MCU, so lots to do, lots of players to introduce, lots of backstory. It was good, not great. Liked the Eternals, but many had little to do and some disappeared for long stretches. Gilgamesh&#39;s super power was being strong and punching deviants in the face. Yawn. When halfway through, my favorite character was Kingo&#39;s &#34;valet&#34;, not a good sign. Also, looked at my watch with well over an hour left in the movie. As for the big end credits add ons - seriously, Harry Styles?
Movie was great, ending had some questionable decisions. Overall 8.5/10
I don’t know why so many peoples dislike this movie! Yes, it is very different from previous MCU entries, but that’s good! This film is beautifully made, with a more adult oriented story. Don’t believe the negative reviews. Give this movie the chance it deserves!
A disappointing disjointed mess. Watch Dune instead.
Terrible. No resemblance whatsoever to the MCU.
It was mostly entertaining, but the characters just weren&#39;t that interesting. Even my kids were somewhat bored and the LOVE Marvel movies.
The Eternals just sets up so many big things forward and changed the MCU alot!! especially the understanding of the Marvel universe itself. it really feels like a different MCU but its a good movie that I do believe everyone should watch and its epic and mindblowing especially the cgi and fight scene. make sure to stay til the end credit scene!!
The story and the fights were executed well. The villain wasn&#39;t great, but the surprise ending was like WOAH!
It was ok. I felt like it was missing something
With mind blowing visuals, thrilling action, and a cast of brand new heroes into the MCU, Eternals sets a new benchmark for things to come for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
A bit slow but it was still good.
The movie was overlong and confusing. Many differences from the comics, which were better. Bad enough that they turned a blonde (Ikarus) into black hair, they changed him from a hero to a villian. The Deviants were nasty but not interesting enough to carry the whole film. The drama among the Eternals seemed more like kids squabbling than real conflict. Maybe the sequel will be better, but don&#39;t count on it.
Fun, Different, Action packed, fun and interesting characters.
I loved the diversity in every part of this movie. It had a great balance of drama and comedy. I&#39;m excited to see where this story takes the MCU.
It was fine. Don&#39;t expect a Marvel movie. Humor really wasn&#39;t there and the story dragged on with the biggest twist pretty predictable.
I really liked that it had open captioning! Gratitude for made this for deaf community and I will go there again.
Excellent acting, good pace, wish there was more time to develop the characters further. but it&#39;s difficult given the number of characters in the movie. This could have been a TV show or several films before another huge world- ending storyline. I just wanted more!
Don’t listen to any negative reviews and watch for yourself! I personally liked this movie but can understand why a non mcu fan could be confused! If your a fan of the MCU this movie is an absolute must see!
Really liked it, gorgeous film, compelling, did a great job of developing agency across a wide cast of new characters
Left movie about halfway through. Androgynous and homo-sexual deities—socialist bs. Also presented allied end to war against fascists as tragic. Conventional ground warfare and carpet bombing killed multitudes more than a-bombs did. But were the bad guys—who started the war? Ignorance of Hollywood is astounding.
Not as bad as I expected, but still was far from my favorite MCU movie. There is definitely some weirdness to this movie and the scope was too big for my liking. There was also a completely uneeded sex scene, which I didn&#39;t care for. Otherwise, there was at least things to like in this movie and I still had fun overall.
A waste of a star power. Angelina Jolie was great. The movie was not. I&#39;m watching the climax now. I hope the post credit scenes aren&#39;t also a let down.
Great visual effects, great cast, entertaining!
Great movie. Requires a longer explanation span, but tots worth it
With this fresh air of of MCU, is the beginning of a new era, of new movies. The ETERNAL, show all the potential as an MCU movie brings us.. the 2 hours long movie did not feel it, you keep on the action..A plus. Go and enjoy your sexy self 😜, have fun..
Not as filled with comedy as a typical MCU film. Eternals took itself seriously, and I REALLY appreciate that!
For a Marvel movie it&#39;s just eh. not the best not the worst just eh.
Loved it can&#39;t wait for the next one
awesome movie. loved all the characters and the lore
The idea of the characters was better than the execution of them. The villains were added nothing to the story.
it was a good origin story! the movie was a bit long but it&#39;s expected of origin stories but good cast.
Very ok. Too much flashback, not enough character development. I felt 0 emotion for any of the characters that died - or that lives for that matter. The most sympathetic character was the villain.
This felt like a love letter to all of us seeking peace with our history. How can super-powered beings feel small in the context of a vast existence around them? Ground them in fecklessness and coercion at the hands of the universe. I had fun watching this movie, and although i didn&#39;t care for the main love triangle very much, this film hit emotional highs and lows. There were pacing issues, and some narrative weakness, but the power of this movie is very much in its heart.
I love a sprawling adventure story, I hope marvel does a TV series that features the eternals in places like Babylon. The scenes in those times left me wanting more
Loved it, don’t care what “movie critics” say. It had so many unexpected turns, funny moments, sad ones too. Visually beautiful and yes is a marvel movie and I’m a fan.
love Marvel! this one gave me a turn as i wasn’t expecting the plot twist!
Great action scenes. A little bit to much talking tho, we could have just watched it regular seats instead of 4dx because the chair movement was minimal. But overall it was a great story with good action scenes.
This movie is a must see. It fits so well in the universe, and I loved that it was not predictable.
overly hyped. Boring. Slow. Plot/storyline lame.
I kept waiting for at least one avenger to show up also Thenas character attacking her team was just dumb
Yeesh. I wish I could get my money AND my time back. What a mess.
I enjoyed it! The new storyline is a bit challenging to understand how it links in with the others, but I&#39;m sure it will all come together. New is !! BTSARMY. Loved the BTS reference and music contribution! Yeah Jimin!! Yeah BTS!!
I loved the depth of each of the characters. Every character felt well-developed, which can be difficult with the amount of characters they had in the movie. The plot remained unpredictable and exciting throughout the course of the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Exellent movie. I guarantee that anyone claiming otherwise either didn&#39;t understand the story, or is upset that it was different from their expectations.
A visually stunning film with lots of heart.
solid movie which opens numerous gates to potential marvel studios down the line! don&#39;t automatically trust the critic reviews, go see it for yourself and gather an opinion
My son and I went to checkout whether the movie was kid friendly. Not only do we have a great time, but he agreed it was one he could watch a second time with the family. It was a great action hero movie minus the blood and guts. I recommend.
I thought it was a good movie overall. For an origin story but it was pretty choppy. I felt lines could have been a little more fluid
Excessively long and parts seemed to drag on. Some characters werent interesting enough.
This movie was so beautifully made and had a completely different feel from any other Marvel movie. All the characters were likable and the story was interesting. I really loved the representation and I hope Marvel makes more movies like this
It seemed very disjointed. Going back to the past then coming back to the present was not a good transition.
Very interesting with some funny moments too
Good character development. Interesting story line. Good mix of action, drama and humor.
I would give no stars if possible, fell asleep a couple times through this movie.
Worst movie I have seen in a long, long time. Total copycat of superpowers of previous superheroes. Recycled plot. Cast had zero chemistry. I havent hated a cast this much since Rogue One and after the movie we all agreed we were hoping theyd all be killed off. We liked one guy and naturally he was the one who died. Fight scenes were lousy. Need a rebooted Tony Stark to save this miserable franchise. Disney. You ruined this just like most of the Star Wars spin-offs.
So I am original owner of the Eternal series in comic books. You make wide allowances for movie/tv interpretations of these stories. Allowing for that.....I thought the movie was well produced/directed. It was a very elaborate story however it was farily easy to follow (unlike the recent Dune mess). It did have a decent ending within this episode with the always Marvel &#34;but wait there is more&#34; lead in for either the next episode or next character introduction. I would like to see it again in video as well later. That is always a good indicator with my wife and I about how we liked a movie....
amazing movie and cast! not enough screen time for each characters though
Awesome special effects... great action scenes... story was a bit weak... but 2.5 hrs of escape
Forgettable, way more dialogues than action sequences considering how lengthy the film is. Couldn’t connect with the characters, no magic moment where you want to jump up and cheer, just doesn’t feel like a Marvel movie.
Loved the casting and the story line. It was a fresh new take on the mcu universe. There is not much dislike other than the CGI could have been better. I didn’t mind the length of the movie.
Left me puzzled and confused. I didn&#39;t feel any attachment to any of the characters, and I didn&#39;t understand why the eternal were ever needed. The Avengers could have fought the deviants and done a great job at it, probably better than this guy&#39;s did. I don&#39;t see the point. I was hoping for a cameo of Thor or some other avenger. It was boring and long-winded. If they were created by some Supreme being, why did this being forget to give one if the eternal a voice? Doesn&#39;t seem very efficient to create a being and not give it the ability to communicate verbally. Not a great action movie in my book.
Eternals was decent but felt more like an Amazon Prime Original than an actual Marvel movie.
Harry Styles Harry Styles Harry Styles Harry Styles Harry Styles Harry Styles Harry Styles Harry Styles Harry Styles Harry Styles Harry Styles Harry Styles !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It was too long, it was slow moving, boring between action scenes. It made me fidgety and want to leave....no character attachment.
dumpster fire. feels like a waste of money
Just seemed to be a bit long and the plot development was a bit repetitive.
I really enjoyed this movie. Its a fun time, beautiful, and it has some cool action. It suffers from pacing issues at times and theres a noticeable lack of on screen chemistry with some of the romance, but overall its worth the outing.
This movie had some good characters, along with an amazing diversity of actors! But the plot got a little off base for me during the ending of the movie with some of the characters. I was a fan of all of the characters at the beginning of the movie, but the ending was a bit disappointing. Enjoy!
The premise of the movie was awesome. The storyline to all other MCU movies interconnected. Lots of drama, action &amp; laughs.
I thought the movie was pretty good. I liked the characters, the humor and the special effects. The &#34;creator&#34; was too &#39;transformer&#39; like for my taste.
Nice escape from the current climate of the world or the everyday of life! Strong cast with solid characters and surprisingly emotional despite all the CGI effects! Totally “Woke” with the Diversity not often seen on screen! Beautifully filmed.
I’ll follow you to the end - Marvel this movie is beautiful!!!!
Full of adventure and humor!
Great movie. It wasn’t necessary to watch the other marvel movies to understand it. The diversity is amazing and the acting is just as great.
Not your typical MCU film. Will leave audience Very divided. I enjoyed the movie personally. Definitely not the worst mcu movie! not sure why the movie received so many negative reviews. Can’t wait for the sequel and stick for the post and mid credit scene! You wouldn’t want to miss it!!!
some of the dialoge dragged a lil , but the fight scenes and story telling were amazing and a prefect set up for the next chapter in the mcu
If the eternals would’ve gotten there a second sooner that kids dad didn’t have to die in that first scene.
a generic version of avengers feels like a b movie not much action and boring.
Different than other marvel movies in a good way
ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING MARVEL MOVIE I SEEN
Its a good movie, I like to watch it again.
Very good movie, one of the best in the MCU. Very action packed and characters you can enjoy. Plus a great story as always. Worth the watch in IMAX.
Love it hope the have a 2 part ❤️❤️❤️
This movie was fantastic! I went into it not sure what to expect, because I heard that reviewers had bonded this movie but for weird reasons. Let me tell you- THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE. If you are bored of the standard heroes journey, then this movie is for you. If you enjoy seeing actually talented actors, as opposed to attractive but ‘meh’ actors, then this movie is for you! If you enjoy lots of action, emotion, and surprise then you’ll love this movie. Go see it, and ignore the reviews! You won’t regret it! :)
I cried so much! Very moving stories!!
There was two fire alarms during the movie and after 1.5 hours we left. We want a refund
Bad cgi but overall good story. Disliked the overuse of celebrities
Really good movie :-)
this movie will ruin religions theology concept.
Beautiful, but overlong and unnecessarily convoluted in places.
I give it a 4.5 because the plot is actually good to the point of seeing how the story unfolds, but the movie had a lot of parts that needed more sound. Also, a lot more teamwork would have been even better. Chloe Zhao did really good for directing this film!
Wonderful movie.. I liked the story line and the action packed fight scenes 😊
Really good! DOESNT deserve all the hate it gets. Spectacular visuals
no motivation of characters
I actually enjoyed this movie. It really set up bigger themes moving forward. I loved the mythology behind each character, sorry Druig, but I do Love me some Barry Keoghan. My favorite character was Kingo, Phastos, and the playfulness between Makkari &amp; Druig.
Boring. Poor story line. Ended without a notable climax, only hinting at yet another boring saga? This movie was not up to Marvel standards.
It was just a terrible movie that only wanted to display its own political ideas rather than tell an enjoyable story that all audiences could enjoy
I liked the set up of the movie, very fresh and new.
While not 100 % faithful to the source material, Eternals adds to the MCU in unexpected if not delightful ways.
Marvel takes it up a notch by being risky but me and my wife LOVED it!
It&#39;s slow getting to the point!
I like the deep meanings and surprises. I didn&#39;t like the lack of action.
In all honesty, the movie was pretty good but I feel they&#39;re rushing a few things here and there. Not going to spoil the film because I&#39;d rather have yall watch it than to spoil it for yall. The action scenes were incredible tho. Each actor did awesome. I would watch it again.
honestly I saw it today I loved it but I feel like something else was missing can&#39;t put my finger to it but i love how it brought in history ,mixed with different cultures , different language and above all the first movie I saw with sign language honestly great movie ♥️
Great Marvel adventure!! Scenery, actors, music, etc all great!
If I could rate zero stars, I would. Nothing redeeming or positive. Bad acting. Bad writing. Bad Movie.
1 of my favorite marvel movies of all time!! I’m going for a 2nd time to watch this movie
This was a great movie, loved the characters and all the twist in it. Wasn’t expecting the ending and I’m so excited for the up coming movies
Great introduction into the further expanse of the MCU! Great to see diversity and inclusivity!
I loved it it! Wasn&#39;t typical marvel movie style more serious historical drama which suited the characters personality perfectly
It was a bit rushed at the beginning but overall it was fun.
Too slow, bad dialogue, and fell asleep
Very suspe full, lille scary but funny as well
I go to the movies to be entertained, not preached at.
movie was long with alot of unnecessary scenes. felt no chemistry between any of the love interests. acting was subpar at best. action scenes were alright but nothing memorable. with I could get my money and 2 1/2 hrs back.
Great story line and special effects
Good effects and now we know what Eternals are, but I thought the story was weak and way too long.
Okay, so I&#39;m a Marvel fan. This movie is an origin story that is going to turn into a huge plot line going forward. Yes, I have questions a out some choices, but overall the CG was amazing, the acting was better than most other Marvel movies, the characters are easy to love, the plot twists are a plenty, and the end credits is exciting. That sounds like a great Marvel movie to me! I loved it. Critics can tear it apart but the fans are going to enjoy it. And that is the goal. Make something to enjoy watching.
Met my expectation, really enjoyed Eternals looking forward to seeing the next one.
While it feels as if the movie is trying its hardest to stand out from what&#39;s come before in the MCU, Eternals is still a beautiful looking film that audiences will enjoy.
I loved the homage to Jack &#34;the King&#34; Kirby and his creation from the 70&#39;s. To see characters, some of his last from the house of ideas on the screen and applied with a spin (looking at the morality of Ikaris along with the unlikely deaths of Ajak and Gilgamesh) took me back to my own mythology taught by Jack &amp; Stan. I appreciated how Chloe took into account Jack&#39;s lineage along with Neils updates and those of others. The movie made me remember and respect Jack even more because he shared his take and view on mythology and how he viewed tales of heroes/villains, the struggle to overcome adversity and the balance of life&#39;s joys/life&#39;s pains and the overall question of mortality while searching for immortality. The Eternals, in my opinion, were Jacks spin on the Olympians. He displayed his love for Greek/Roman tales and absconded their images and accounts to create something familiar, yet new. With new villains with an accompany new vigor for conflict for a young comic book audience. My first meeting of Ikaris left me thinking this was a perfect hero. Not a perfect character, but yet a perfectly planned hero. He was courageous, selfless, powerful with numerous abilities, impervious in battle along with immortal but also humble. A leader, but not a boss. Thena was the boss by default with the brashness that goes with being the daughter of Zuras and a shadow of Athena. Ikaris by intention, was the icon of the Eternal family. To be honest, I never really compared or identified him with Superman, until after the movie. Never viewed Superman as a perfect hero. He had similar qualities to Ikaris, but he often seemed aloof to me. Not really attached to the human condition beyond observer and pitying savior, but still alien. Ikaris was immortal but he and his family shared a common root/beginning with the soul of humanity. Yes, he and his family are Homo Immortus, but again he can be found along the root of the human tree. Jack made him an earthling, for his beginnings. Jacks lineage is his explaination not only for the Eternals, but all the other offshoots of the human family that tie the Marvel Saga together. Marvel is an amalgamation of families, Atlantian, mutant, Asgardian, Olympian, Kree, Skull, Shi&#39;ar, Inhuman, super-human and Homo Sapien. Each tells a story but also adds another piece to the puzzle of an orchestrated masterpiece that was first spelled-out and drawn. This to me is the foundation.
Great movie. I really enjoyed it.
The pacing and storytelling was amazing!! Cinematography is stellar, the colors are vibrant and the characters are given time to develop and connect with the audience. Excited for the next one.
Not as amazing as I expected it to be, but still pretty good. I thought the writing and performances were great, but the photography was a bit static and boring (which itself was distracting for that reason). Other than the big green-screen shots where theyre running and flying around everywhere, it was just close-up talk talk talk, close-up talk talk talk, close-up talk talk talk However, I will say that Gemma Chan is so much better than I thought she could be.
This is definitely one of the most different marvel films out there and that is not a bad thing. Good movie 5/5
Pretty boring, too long, good action, but really boring. If you like Marvel movies and only know the lore on a surface level I guess it would be ok.
Great story, excellent acting and superb action scenes. Can’t wait to see the next chapter in the saga!
a lot of back story, decent amount of action.
Marvel failed me big time! This movie is all over the place, the plot is revealed in the most boring way and the characters are just so forceful. Its cringe most of the time. It even has a bed scene that made me wonder if this is Marvel?? The only good thing is the comedy, which basically carries the whole movie. They did put same sex marriage and the race diversity, which is a prominent point. Overall, I regret watching this movie!
Full of action and excitement.
It’s was like watching a 2 1/2 hour filler episode of a mediocre Disney + show.
great cast..good storyline
I originally was cautioned about the movie and it’s shitty plot line but after I got my ticket I walked in with a clean slate and open mind and while admittedly, there’s some holes in the plot and not marvel’s best work... I would say it was a definite must watch because these characters are going to end up playing a big role eventually in the MCU
A bit everywhere and tries to do to many things with too many characters, but enjoyable enough
Absolutely needs to be viewed as the start of the next chapter. Go with a open mind and disregard what critics say. The Eternals are a mystery even to some regular comic readers so don&#39;t feel weird if you get confused, here and there. They do a good job getting you up to speed. Recommend.
It was definitely a different Marvel experience I really enjoyed seeing it
Philosophy from robots? Senseless and heavy handed.
Ambitious but bloated. And still not enough time to make most of the characters interesting. Beautifully shot, but the writing felt weak, and the few jokes it had fell flat. Overall it lacked the pop and charm of the usual Marvel movies.
This was a beautiful film, with interesting characters. Can&#39;t wait to see what happens next.
Incredible cinematic experience!! The visual effects were astounding!! A total must see even for the non Marvel fan!! And make sure you stay for the two end scenes!!!
Amazing movie! Definitely worth watching
Something new from Marvel, maybe their most spiritual movie. asks a lot of big questions and surprises you with the story. looks great in IMAX
Needed more action... Also I hope marvel doesn&#39;t start wildin like this again. With the sex scenes same sex households
Loved every second of it. Beautiful and stunning
(No Stars) i left after an hour and 25 minutes. it was so bad up to that point that nothing in it&#39;s remaining time could redeem it. bad acting, bad direction and pointless storyline ...even for a fantasy film it was overall a waste of time.
Not your typical marvel movie, plenty of talking and set up, but its cool. Action sequences were dope, story made sense too. What a cast!!
Everything felt rushed and there are several things which don&#39;t make sense. Maybe as this phase goes along it will improve the view of this film but it was a pretty good mess on its own.
Good in-between movie, it mostly serves to expand the universe and was entertaining.
The movie is different from what we are use to see from marvel but still a good movie, I think they miss the chance to find the own Superman on ikaris by making him kind of the bad guy because being him like that a lot of people not gonna like him.
could&#39;ve used more character development, but the plot line and action sequences were good. mid credit and end credit scenes were great!
OK movie but thats if youre in the fairytales and I have a big imagination little too much for me
A little slow. But liked the banter back and forth with the characters. And I liked all the characters. Sad what happens to some of them. And excited for the sequel. Especially if Eros has a big role in it.
Very good movie. And really good actors!!
This movie is gorgeous! Doesn’t deserve the hate that is getting. All the characters are very likable and it’s very different from other MCU movies, which is refreshing.
I laughed. I cried. I would’ve watched 2 more hours of it if I could.
Worst MCU movie ever!
I don&#39;t understand why the movie got so low a rating it&#39;s just like every marvel movie out
Stay at the end of the credits !! It will give you goosebumps and chills
Interesting flick, great characters, hits all the modern buttons, probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn&#39;t stopped reading comics 50 years ago.
Well written great action scenes
The 3D conversion is bad. I wasn&#39;t invested in the characters until the 3rd act. I really felt the run time.
In my opinion it fell flat. It wasn’t the worst but it wasn’t all that it was hyped up to be either . It was just meh 😑. This is the first Marvel movie I would say this about. I’ve always enjoyed all of their movies now the past but this one just didn’t hit the mark. I had to do it again I would wait to rent it or watch on Disney+.
Loved the movie and the end credit scenes were just as good!!
Worst movie I ever seen DONT waste ur lifespan on this
It did exactly what it needed to do! For people like me who don’t follow the comics or have that knowledge of the whole Eternals back story, who they are and they’re purpose in the universe, the movie does an A+ job setting that story up for them. I think they overestimated how much we needed because there was a lot of filler scenes that I think could’ve been kept, which is why the movie feels long. Other than that, I loved it.
My fianc and I have watched all the marvel movies and were hooked on the avengers series along with all the character movies. We were expecting the same marvel goodness and we felt disappointed. Story line wasnt as strong , never really got to know any of the characters very well. It was all over the place. Kind of felt like there was some forced social status for todays times - didnt bother , but just felt like those scenes could have went to better use , instead. Too much fluff in this movie. And Thanos brother (spoiler alert) is Harry styles?! Lmfao cmon Marvel well still see the second coming of this movie but we wont expect much.
A little long, but still a very good movie and worth seeing in theaters.
Great story and way better than I thought it would be
The story-line was a surprise to me considering the trailers i&#39;d seen, but it was a good movie all around.
beautifully shot, well acted and it greatly expanded the possibilities of the MCU.
I like sifi, so I enjoyed the movie, my husband said he thought it was ok. He likes blood and guts movies
New type of Marvel movie. A couple of mature scenes. Great scenery and themes
pretty good for sci-fi
liked it. Would watch it again.
I enjoyed this movie more than Shang Chi. It is very different though. There are some scenes that could be jarring for some people because you wouldn&#39;t normally see in the MCU.
A bit long winded. Not enough tie-in to the marvel universe.
We went to see the movie as a family and we really enjoy the movie and all the action on it. We also like the end credit scene.
a little long &amp; at times the storyline was slow. I am glad I saw it but don&#39;t think I would watch it again
The emotional and ethical context was far more complex than in any previous Marvel movie, which made it more involving in a non-superficial way.
Fun if confusing story line and great special effects. But way too long and drawn out. Still, it was mostly enjoyable.
It’s was ok, I was expecting more from a Marvel movie. There seam to be some continuity issues.
For better or for worse this really doesn’t feel like a marvel movie. Lots of exposition, weird pacing, some moments of questionable CGI. Characters felt forced on the audience. I can’t say I remember all their names or care that they existed. Story was weak and predictable. It does have a a decent finale and sets up some great stuff for future marvel films.
Exciting, cool, great music
Hecka good action. Good character development. I would definitely watch again.
So slow. I didn&#39;t really care about any of the characters.
I liked the special effects. I mostly liked the storyline. Costumes were great! Historically inaccurate, hanging gardens turn out not to be in Babylon but in Nineveh. Only 5.6% of U.S. population is LGBTQ, so Im really having a bad taste from the entertainment industry forcing it down my throat.
I like it, critics don’t. I think the movie is ok and not bad. I think some people expect a lot from it, and was disappointed. It is long that has a good story. It did felt like I DC movie. It had Superman, lol
The plot/story line was way more complex than I had imagined. Good acting &amp; neat CGI! Little too woke in parts.
OK movie but it’s basically a copy of other films. Not really original, and has too many similarities with other movies and characters.
It was just ok for me. Kinda boring in some stretches. I dosed off a couple of times. Bring back the #Avengers ! Lol
Great cast, entertaining
Such a great movie that sets up the next phase of the MCU!
it was ok I guess.....
While being a film in the MCU. This definitely isn’t for people expecting avengers level drama. Or guardians humor. It’s definitely a filler story to tie the infinity saga to whatever comes next. It’s necessary but not exciting.
love It I want to see it again
Worth seeing. Beautiful to watch. Good acting by the leads. A little slow at times, but picks up toward the end. Somewhat limited by the amount of exposition required to make sense of the source material.
I never really cared for any of the characters in the film. It was entertaining enough.
Good entertainment with plenty of action
Very enjoyable and a lot of action, but very confusing as to who was who.
Great way to start the new phase 4 for whats to come in the MCU, a lot of details to reference the comics with the new powers at play, some may feel that its a lot of info but its way better that we got all this info in one movie and not 3. Excited for the MCU to blow up
Too long and way too unrealistic. Now I know what &#34;over-the-hill&#34; actors do when they&#39;re past their prime.
The movie was very good. I enjoyed the different tone then other marvel movies. It’s more serious and doesn’t do one liners in serious parts. I feel like this opens the door for marvel to try different things can’t wait to see what happens next
Too slow. Too long. Not enough action. Couldn&#39;t they come up with some different monsters?
Oh, jeezus! Just so much mindless violence. These &#34;deviants&#34; were just monsters invented to move the &#34;&#34;plot&#34; (such as it is) along. I think that maybe it&#39;s aimed at a younger demographic than I belong to. I usually enjoyed most of the other Marvel movies, like &#34;Dr. Strange.&#34; At least that one kept me engaged.
I really enjoy this movie, love the story and characters
I liked this movie, but never buy a extra large sized soda for these movies.
Not my favorite marvel movie by far, but I did enjoy the movie. Sets up future movies for sure, but the movie was fairly predictable.
What a great Marvel movie, I hope there is another one that will be out soon.
Funny, action packed film with beautiful cinematography and music.
A little slow for a marvel movie.
Not the best superhero movie but definitely better than better than Fantastic Four, Hulk, and Thor the Dark World. Just reshape your expectations and you will find a decent movie here
Standalone mythology. Great concepts!
Premise of the story was little hard to understand but the story itself was good
Finally seeing the Marvel universe BEHIND the Marvel Universe.
A great cast does not always mean a great movie. The story was confusing and disjpinted. The artwork and special effects have been done before, giving it a similar feel to other Marvel movies, but there was nothing original in it. I watch most Marvel movies over and over. this won&#39;t be one of them.
Another awesome MCU movie. The movie provided a great back story for the Eternals and their relationship to the MCU. Highly recommended!
I was surprised that I ended up liking it. For the most part I liked each character. The story was so different from other Marvel films, so it wasn&#39;t a rehash of old things like the other films.
Entertaining movie, but not of the same caliber as we have become accustomed to from Marvel. Nevertheless, I am still looking forward to a sequel.
A bit too long in runtime, 10 main characters is pushing it when trying to have a concise story. But I did enjoy the concepts and idea, it just wasn’t executed the way I hope it would. It’s slow at first but picks up in the second act. Leaves you wanting more for sure like most Marvel movies.
This is a VERY ambitious film and although not perfect I&#39;d still give it at least a 7 out of 10 - there were some awkward character interactions in the first 20 minutes or so but then the film found it&#39;s pace and was really good from them on - would definitely see again and recommend to all Marvel fans
Movie was way to long . Dont know what they were trying to achieve to begin with . Thought the guy was really Starfox. Smh
just a woke soap opera the veteran actors were mediocre at best I&#39;d wait for it to come out on Netflix and then I&#39;d have a back-up plan
too preachy and no characters to really like.
At least now I know what it would look like for Marvel to make a DC movie.
I was at the edge of my seat the whole time. The fighting scenes where sooo dope. I laughed I cried I was happy. I was connected. The story was outstanding and the visuals was a masterpiece
Just couldn’t get into this movie. So much going on in all different directions. Couldn’t keep up with who was good/bad and if a new person on screen was a Eternal or just some random person in the movie. When you keep looking at your watch wondering how much longer you had to sit there, it’s time to go. Gave in around 2 hours and waived the white flag.
movie was great! a little slow sometimes, but that is to be expected cause they have a lot of explaining to do. visual effects are awesome as expected.
I really like the action scenes and the aid give to mankind to survive actors were great.
You can&#39;t win &#39;em all, and this was Marvel&#39;s first true swing and a miss. Most of the humor fell flat, except where Kumail Nanjiani was present. The writing was sloppy and had some plot points that made no sense. The director had a clear vision in mind, but one which most would say was forced.
I really enjoyed the movie! I feel like it gave people a pretty good background on The Eternals. The visuals were beautiful and very well done. I cant wait for the next one!
Beautifully shot and raising great questions about human nature, Eternals is by far the most mature Marvel movie to date, and one that will likely bring the good, the bad, and the ugly out of its audience just like it did to its characters. With that said, it suffers from uneven pacing, excessively heavy characters, and a disappointing &#34;let&#39;s wrap it up somehow&#34; third act.
You got lost with who is who in the switching back and forth in time. Did not hold my attention. Left movie within 45 minutes of start.
I love the scale of the events taking place and the characters in the movie. The writing seems sloppy at times. Overall was a fantastic entry to the MCU which explored corners of the universe we haven&#39;t seen yet.
It was too drawn out and disjointed.
I didnt notice that the movie was long - it was very interesting from start to finish. Loved the action sequences, the characters powers and strengths and some of the humor. Its nice to see Angelina Jolie in her element again! I hope Marvel creates a movie just about her character!
An extremely complex plot that almost demands a 2nd viewing.
So good! We are going to have to see it several times to catch all the innuendos, just like all the Avenger movies! And the clip after--- Jaw dropping!
the characters are some of the strongest in the mcu with great dynamics, but the plot is a bit thin.
Story line hard to follow, acting was mediocre, very disappointing for a Marvel movie
Super boring. I thought I might be watching a DC movie instead of a Marvel movie.
With everything this movie was trying to set up, most of it worked, even though the jumps through time were jarring at times. Performances were all great, visuals were some of, if not, the best in the MCU thus far. The ending I hated though. While it was visually jaw dropping, the reason behind it I just didn’t like. Overall, the story was the thing that faltered for Eternals.
It was slow somewhat but I did enjoy the story behind it. I’m hoping the sequels are better though.
It wasn&#39;t one of your typical Marvel movie, I assume that&#39;s what some will find unpleasing about it, but that&#39;s what I loved about it. I will continue to say one of the best Marvel films to date.
Great entertaining Movie
Too many plot holes!!
The story was very interesting, and the scale of the storyline was great!
It definitely wasn’t your typical action at every corner Marvel movie but I felt it was a good building block for quite a few future movies.
Boring and very slow. Too much not-to-funny slapstick humor for a sci-fi movie. Dont waste your time on this one!
It was a really awesome movie!
Slow burning but entertaining
Beautiful movie, but had no connection to the MCU. A lot of missed opportunities to connect the history. Unfortunately there’s no reason to root for these heroes with zero relatability to them.
I enjoyed it and the 3D movie experience. I looking forward to the next movies in the series as the characters are developed.
Dense film but great acting and great cinematography
Being a comic book fan before there was an MCU, this movie resonates with me a lot and the suspension of disbelief is needed to enjoy this movie - and I have grown up in the world of comics in which I’ve practiced a lot of suspension of disbelief in secret back then because it wasn’t hip at the time. This is the mythology of the Marvel Comics Universe being introduced to the cinematic medium (its creation story) and I just watched it today after weeks of listening to the leaks and reading the critics reviews to which I finally understand why there is so much negative criticism to this movie. I loved the ETERNALS movie story since I already was connected to this mythology long before which makes me biased in a way but also informed as to how to enjoy it. I can understand the negativity coming from the critics who didn’t grow up reading comics as a way of entertainment and escapism. Hopefully going forward whatever the seeds that Feige has planted from this movie will eventually bare fruit and make everyone who loves the cinematic universe appreciate how it is all connected - especially since we still have yet to be introduced to the X-Men and Fantastic Four to which this story is very essential to their origins. I can only hope audiences will like this hinted origin story for the MCU as a whole years down the road when all the plot threads come to their own conclusion.
Don&#39;t expect this to be like a regular marvel movie. This two and a half hour movie feels like they crammed in all of phase one of avengers into one movie. Nothing was explained and characters were being introduced and killed off so fast it was hard to feel anything for them.
I had the opportunity to see this twice and it was better on the second viewing for me personally. The story is dense, so I was able to see things that I missed the first time around and it definitely paid off for me. it&#39;s a beautiful film, and the story is solid. Also, I felt more emotionally invested when I viewed it the second time. My rating increased on the second viewing and I&#39;m down to see it again.
I loved it. The movie had so much diversity and a great plot.
I really enjoyed the way in which the film was made. The cinematography was unbelievable and felt a serious tone to the movie, while they do add splashes of the Marvel comedy that we know. As someone who didn’t know anything about the Eternals, I like the story of how they came to be and who they are now. Although some parts could’ve been cut to make the movie perhaps 20-30min shorter. Nevertheless, still enjoyed the movie, the acting, the action sequences, and learning the new vast information about these universes.
No emotional connection to characters. Sersi didnt do much the entire movie, plot seemed a little scattered
Justice league wanna be
Loved it! It was a great movie! We are going to go see it again.
Funny how Rotten Tomatoes shows such a bad score. So much more to factor in than thinking it’s a one-time pic with a finite position in movie history. It’s a good movie.
One of the best Marcel movie ever!!! Love it!!
Best film of the year
Absolutely loved this movie, can&#39;t wait to see where they go with it.
Marvel is starting over with new characters that aren&#39;t widely recognized
I loved this film. I was intrigued from start to finish
I will always support Marvel trying something different!
I liked the plot of the story as well as the characters and the way the actors portrayed them. Can’t wait to rewatch this movie
I thought it was good and it was unexpected.
I wouldn&#39;t want to spoil the mood a person would feel by giving anyone a clue. Enjoy yourself!!
Too long and too many characters. Diversity was good to see. Deviants distracted from the story. I would go see it again. I cannot wait for the sequel.
Great movie!! Marvel keeping up with the tradition of great story telling
Overall I thought the movie was amazing! It was just different from the normal marvel moviebut thats what made it stand out for me
Such an epic story spanning from the beginning of humanity through the ages and to the present day MCU! Exceeded all my expectations and so glad i held out from watching a movie in the actual theater for Eternals!!
Gotta give this a 6.6/10. I enjoyed it but felt it was a middle of the pack marvel movie. It needed more development into the eternals journey vs short back stories/clips. This movie was long but felt like it should have been longer. I definitely think I&#39;ll like the sequel better because it already feels like it will be more action packed
It was a great movie. Cant wait for the sequel. Lots of action.
Beautiful movie, great ensemble, speedster done right, love the diverse cast and putting marginalized people in the forefront as heroes.
Not as bad as what people are saying. It was decent.
Director really took her time with the character development and relationship dynamics amongst the Eternals. Will watch again
For Marvel, I think it underperformed, there were parts of the story line that either needed to be more reenforced or cut out because they didn&#39;t have enough impact to the movie. could still be a good starting point for a new saga though. Only time will tell.
It was... meh... really long and slow. I almost fell asleep. Took forever to develop the story which was lackluster, as was the romance between Icarus and Sersi, which I found unconvincing. Which is a shame because I love the actors. And the humor... weak, when there was humor.
This is a great movie to watch! Awesome special effects, a lot of twists, amazing photography, fantastic cast, wonderful editing, a great plot, and 2 end credit scenes that you don’t want to miss.
great movie will come see it again
Bad for marvel movie
Very entertaining, I loved some of the set up for future material.
It was a pretty decent movie but it felt a little too long. I&#39;m not apposed to long movies but it felt unnecessarily slow. Other than that it was pretty good, the cast was perfect.
Overall, I thought it was a good film. I liked the cinematography, the visuals, and special effects. I think there was a lot of dull moments throughout the film. I was expecting reveals of connections to historic moments and new characters that have existed throughout the Marvel Universe. I think I was expecting more from the main story to further develop the expansion of the Marvel Universe. Again, it was a good movie overall, but not among the best that Marvel has to offer
I really liked it! A great start to the future of the Eternals.
Great movie. Marvel has a brand new flavor!
So yeah, just finished watching Eternals and I have to say, it was a truly excellent film: pacing, action, story were all on point and it was visually stunning. The story and tone were darker than most MCU films and the theme of family, duty, loyalty and faith were all touched upon in great ways. The visual effects were AMAZING!!! Ikaris flight and his battles along with Thenas and Makarris were top notch. I see why people might be overwhelmed with the characters and felt there wasnt enough development for them. I guess that is a problem if you go into the film blind with no comic knowledge. I would definitely watch this again.
I liked it when the heroes battle the villains
I was very surprised by this film. They did a great job between story and action. There was a lot of story but it made sense and it made you feel for these characters. It’s a good movie. Go watch it.
Great film! Marvel has done it again! Action, love, emotion,decisions, hits every feeling on the spectrum! Gotta love it!
Could have done without the gay scene
I enjoy movie, but why wasn&#39;t more heroes involved for end of world?
Unfortunately the film is drawn out and boring at times - its misdirected and poorly acted... The premise and effects are cool... But the film overall isn&#39;t good. The music was also mediocre.
it was hard to know which eternal to follow.
It was very slow moving
Very convoluted story with some bad scripting in places. Fans of the comic book may be disappointed to find the story unrecognizable and the characters completely and utterly changed. The cast is excellent and it looks really great. But I&#39;ve never been so disappointed in a Marvel film.
I cancelled those tickets and bought tickets for Tuesday, the 9th.
Personally, I loved this movie. Gorgeous, loved the story and characters. It definitely has a different feel from most MCU films, but to be honest I kinda liked that (and I am a huge Marvel fan) I get that it may not be everyone’s cup of tea… but worst MCU movie to date? That’s just nuts to me, This is a smart,, well crafted, film with characters I genuinely connected with.
It was beautifully shot which is something that you would expect from Chloe Zhao. It was a bit long but with an ensemble cast this large giving background and screen time adequately to each I can see how it happened. That being said the action wasn&#39;t up to the normal levels of Marvel until the third act. It definitely doesn&#39;t deserve the level of vitriol that it&#39;s gotten from critics.
Great movie! Not your typical Marvel movie but good storytelling and keeps you interested. Some corny stuff but it’s Disney what do you expect?🤷🏻‍♂️😂
I loved it, awesome visuals!
The best part of this movie was when it ended
The big ask of Eternals is whether we can get to know and care about an entire cast of new characters without any advance introduction, and in my opinion they pulled it off. The storyline is intriguing, the acting is top-tier, there are plenty of light hearted moments and humor, the effects are gorgeous and the cinematography is stunning. Can&#39;t wait to see it again!
The Diverse cast. Asian, Hispanic, Black, Caucasian, Indian, Handicaped.
I like that is was easy to follow the story line also I like the balance of comedy and action
The opening Salvo on another Marvel Franchise. Good action far reaching storyline
if you love your marvel movies, this one won&#39;t disappoint. lots of laughs, feels and entertainment.
it was great!, dragged a bit long. but definitely liked it. was different directions marvel went, but it paid off
This is definitely not your typical Marvel movie. While I applaud new characters and diversity, the film was very slow and very long. Don’t see this if you’re expecting the typical action packed, usual characters. Although the film had action, it just never reached my Marvel expectation. The critics were right about this one.
Overall the plot and the ending was great
Great story, great characters, and well acted. Doesn&#39;t always keep your attention early, but when the action starts, it&#39;s very intense. As good as any stand alone movie in the MCU.
Wasn’t bad, kinda slow. Basically no good fight scenes.
Cast was really good, but you either don&#39;t get enough time with some, or aren&#39;t given enough to care about some of them. But action and story was really good. Fun time overall.
The movie was good but a little slow in places with not alot of explanation as to how they got to that scene. I felt there were gaps that I couldn&#39;t fill in, like, Thena kills the main Digient but he had given the rest of his group his powers too but what happened to them? Also, Cerci was with Dean when she was pulled away along with the &#34;machanic&#34; and Thena but they were in different places. Why didn&#39;t the others get taken too. Also, if the Celestial created them all, why didn&#39;t he just hit the &#34;kill&#34; button on the computer to make them not challenge him and save earth? I hope the second movie addresses these issues.
We&#39;ve watched all the Marvel movies so far but we are not into the comic books that the movies are based upon. It starts slow with a ton of backstory and character building. Then there&#39;s the middle and then it just ends. We&#39;re left with feeling completely underwhelmed by the end of the movie. We&#39;re stuck with being unimpressed by the casting. Our own previous grades of the cast members in their other appearances may be too low to appreciate their contributions towards this movie. Maybe the next movie will be better...if there is one at all. Another thing is we went on Monday after the premiere at 2:30 in the afternoon. There were only 4 other people. I&#39;m stuck wondering if others felt low of the movie as well. We figured being a Marvel movie just after opening weekend would still have demand. There were funny parts, some sad parts, and lots of lazers, explosions and drama. There are 2 post credit scenes. Our feelings of the ending were only slightly improved after seeing both and we&#39;re still not thrilled with having spent 2 hours 45 minutes in the theater. Just blah.
A slowest marvel movie but really good.
Was a really good movie. I would&#39;ve watched if it was an hour longer to explain a few more things. Overall good graphics and story.
As a stand alone movie the story was well executed. My only complaints are the final sequence was underwhelming for the threat level and the movie itself is too crowded. This is an origin story for more than 10 people if you include the antagonist, and it just feels as though some of them get cheated in screentime and character development. Beyond that, this movie is plagued by the expectations of the Marvel community. The storytelling is not of the same style, and not everyone is ready to give this movie the clean slate it deserves. I would&#39;ve made this a Disney+ series to allow it the slow burn it yearns to give it&#39;s audience.
Each character had weight to them. CGI festival mixed with good story concepts. Not worth the IMAX screen, but worth the trip to the movies. Angelina Jolie still got it. I want more of Lauren Ridloff and her character.
Absolutely thrilling!!!!
It feels so amazing to have the MCU do something like this. I&#39;m a fan of sweeping-yet-grounded sci-fi films, so it was an absolute joy to see this done for the MCU. This movie feels like watching the director&#39;s cut of a movie, which was a delight to realize in the theater. The scale of this is simply breathtaking. I found myself caring for characters that I didn&#39;t think I would based on the trailers, and even remembered several characters&#39; names (which is very rare for me). I will be seeing this again later this week - in IMAX this time.
Though many critics disagree, Eternals is a must-see Marvel movie. Great characters, plot and action scenes add up to an absolute delight. Definitely watch!
About what youd expect from a film trying to cram 7,000 years into 2 1/2 hours. Some decent action and visual effects though.
Most unique and original story so far in the MCU
I really enjoyed it but it was too long. Easily could have been about 30 minutes shorter. The story, the acting and actors, the CGI, the costumes, etc were all amazing. Angelina Jolie&#39;s character was really odd - she didn&#39;t seem to fit in with the others at all, and I could have done without her storyline altogether.
Great story! And visuals. One of the better Marvel movies
Exciting but the plot was choppy. I realize everything cant be explained. My husband is severely hearing impaired. The teleprompter we were given had a dead battery and same with the head gear. He was disappointed and voiced his concerns. He was comped a ticket. I hope that problem is fixed by then.
incredible unique marvel movie
Loved it! The special effects, the storyline, the amazing cast. Spectacular!
This movie was ambitious. To some it could be a bit much with its pacing, but i thoroughly enjoyed this film. Amazing special effects, great characters, great performances. Action scenes were really stellar. I&#39;m not sure why this movie got all the hate it received. It wasn&#39;t the best mcu film, but it was really worth the watch in imax
next time use the source material
I loved the movie and I love the idea of there being more powerful beings in the MCU. The whole idea of cosmic power has got my blood pumping for the future of the MCU as far as the threat for Earth goes.
Loved it better the 2nd time around
It is a Decent Origin Movie
It was the worst movie I think Ive ever seen.
EXCELLENT movie!! I would definitely watch it again!
Entertaining enough eye-candy. All in all: Confusing, a bit too long, and trying too hard to be diverse w/ the characters. Fight scenes should have been edited a little more, less jumping around w/ flash-backs would have helped also. Ending unsatisfactory. Although appreciated Even the two extra-during final credits bits didn&#39; t help so much. Not the worse Marvel, not the best, by any means. Thank you, Julie and Dennis
Existentialism. Who doesn’t grapple with that?
Really enjoy the movie and eagerly anticipate for their next movie. Movie was long but it’s understandable given they have to explain some stuff.
would&#39;ve been better as a standalone movie.
Seemed disconnected throughout the movie.
Awesome! stay for the two cutscenes after the movie
Refreshing storyline and worth watching.
It’s a different Marvel movie. I don’t quite get the critics score but everyone is entitled to an opinion. This was my first Chloe Zhao movie and heard about her take on visuals and I wasn’t disappointed. Trying not to spoil but the villain were good not great. The images of the celestials were impressive.
Fresh relook on the comics. Took my 13yr old daughter, she loved it
An ambitious, but misguided expansion of the MCU. Zhao&#39;s camerawork and sense of place is stunning - but the pacing &amp; density of the script makes it unpleasant to sit through.
Another great entry in the ever-expanding catalog of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  We miss our long-term cast of familiar faces, but with Shang-Chi and now The Eternals we&#39;re starting to see the new list of heroes taking shape.  After the threat of Thanos, I was wondering how they&#39;d get a big baddie that could match or exceed the danger that our last main villain posed.  That question has been answered.  And the mid-credit and end-credit scenes have me very excited for what&#39;s to come.
While I have some minor quibbles, this movie was right up my alley. Dense, delicious philosophical and moral questions, excellent action, huge implications going forward all more than make up for any minor negative issues I had. Except, I agree with others who say the CGI in the mid credit scene was inexcusably terrible. This movie really does change everything for the MCU going forward. Love the way Marvel is stretching the bounds and look forward to move of this.
Fun movie, really liked the characters. It was all pretty predictable tbh, but was overall a fun watch
Dope definitely not for everyone but still super dope
This movie was dope. Not sure what everyone was expecting. Def going to see again!
Visually stunning although it could have been shortened a bit. Good plot not sure why critics thought it was clunky
It held my interest, good effects, a couple of good twists
I have to wonder if there is an Eternals variant going around infecting the brains of critics and some viewers because this movie is a breath of fresh air. I loved it so much.
As a marvel fan &amp; a big MCU supporter this movie is a big letdown. I don’t know how this movie got made. Save your money it’s only good for Angelina Jolie &amp; that’s it! Not a good film!
Don&#39;t believe the griping critics. This is a film of singular vision and everything from the characters, settings, plot, and pacing was masterful. I was blown away by repeated twists, and at times, despite the great pacing, the depth of the film felt more like a novel than a blockbuster. In a really great way. I&#39;m blown away.
Gorgeous filmmaking, beautiful score, and phenomenal character acting and world building. Can get a little slow/long in parts, but overall a great addition to the MCU.
Good story, great special effects, room to grow a franchise or at least a sequel.
It was way too drawn out with very little excitement or comedy. They couldve cut an hour out and it still wouldve made sense.
Gilgamesh and Merkkari were likable characters and Druig while not likable was interesting, the other 5 I have no interest in following their path through the MCU like the Avengers. Not a terrible movie, but quite a letdown. Can&#39;t see myself interested in most of the characters going forward. Even my 14 yr old son gave it a 6 out of 10.
Very much enjoyed the film! While I did have some gripes with certain parts of the story, I was hit with plot twists, few but great action sequences, and an existential crisis perspective of the Eternals that kept me engaged, thinking, and extremely intrigued about their future impact on the MCU’s development. Personally, this is visually and cinematographically the best of the MCU (thank you Chloé) and I hope to see more of these risks from Marvel in the future.
Action scenes were decent but in between it was drawn out and boring. Many people in full theater began snoring halfway through.
Your review will help others decide whether to watch.
Great cast and great cinematic action!
The explanation as to why they didn&#39;t interfere when Ultron and Thanos threatened the Earth was contradictory to their mission. The CGI on Pip the troll was pathetic. Pip deserved better.
It was a breath of fresh air from the usually Marvel format. A solid &#34;In the beginning ... and now&#34; storyline. Fresh characters and visuals ... a &#34;rewatchable&#34; movie with many facets to appreciate.
predictable twist, slow pace, lack of a real villain
We liked the movie very much, cant wait to see the next one
The cinematography and direction is top notch, with a beautifully crafted story and emotional heartbeat. This is a movie that does representation right, and is going to usher in the next generation of (Marvel) story-telling. By no means was it a perfect movie, but with such a grand scale in both story and amount of characters, Eternals delivers an epic next chapter to the MCU.
Great movie with a decent story. Kept my attention throughout (because I needed to know who was who).
Eternals (2020) is a great film! This film is action-packed, entertaining, thought-provoking, and character-focused. This film gave me chills and really introduces the cosmic-awe that the MCU can have. It also had a good balance of comedy. I&#39;m really excited about what else is in store for phase-4 of the MCU!
It was confusing and just didnt have the entertainment punch that literally every other Marvel movie has had.
Gets too hated it&#39;s has a good plot twist, sad moments, and awesome fights.
Liked the ensemble. Story was long , a lot of information to understand.
I loved movie. even though it&#39;s a Marvel, action, superhero movie, it gives you plenty of thinking points. if you take the time to look, the movie allows you many different points of view about life. no one character is purely evil, nor perfect. I love the visuals. my favorite characters include Thena, Druig, Gilgamesh and Makkari. I&#39;m hoping to find time to watch again in the theater/IMAX and again on Disney+ when it arrives. some people may not like this movie because it isn&#39;t as &#39;action-packed&#39; as others, but really, how many punches/blows do we need to see Captain America, Thor or Iron Man throw? this movie had action that didn&#39;t make me wish it would hurry up and get to the story it fit without being overbearing. Thank you.
Lot going on,but what is going on is beautiful.
Really enjoyed the movie definitely top 10 Mavel. Would recommend
Slow and boring, characters nothing like comics in the name of a woke society. Literally jumped the shark in this one with Angelina Jolie, so many more actresses they could of gotten be miss here
The movie could have been so much better, not well put together. some of the acting was really bad.
Since it was a movie discussing the origins why they do what they do and where they came from I understand that the action sequences in the story mother might’ve drank a little bit so it was OK I wouldn’t say it’s one of the best Marvel movies.
I highly recommend watching it in 3D, it was perfectly.
This movie isn&#39;t for everyone. If you skip dialogue scenes to get to the fights when you rewatch movies, you might not care for this. If you like movies with world-building and exposition, as some of us do, it&#39;s a great movie. It asks important questions such as what is the real difference between heroes and villains. There are 2 credits scenes. Make sure you stay for both.
Interesting concepts Pretty good characters, although there are too many characters Great diversity Should have been Disney+ show
Druig was great! Blade in the post-credit scene was amazing too!
Beautiful story and visually.
So Eternals was....good. Not great, just good.
Little slow in the beginning but took off about a 3rd of the way in.
It was really slow and painful. The emotions they are trying to portray were not able to sway, acting was also subpar. None of the actors were able to leave a mark due to the uneven pace of the story. So much talent wasted. For the first time, I can say it was a waste of money to watch this Marvel movie.
Slow at times but all in all I thoroughly enjoyed it! Can&#39;t wait for the next one!
Very ambitious, somewhat hard to follow. Good acting. Good CGI.
Many people won’t appreciate the time they took to set up the characters and explore their humanity. I felt that the story telling was fantastic, the action was solid, the development and furthering of the cinematic universe was done with care.
Sub par direction. Plot riddled with loopholes.
Definitely worth it.
The movie was too unorganized, too many back and forths trying to establish a point. It took forever for the trama to unwind and for the first time a Marvel movie felt fake and unplanned.
Very interesting movie, I think it was very well done.
More story of the purpose of the eternals and how they shape the Earth over 5,000 years.
Great movie. I like the new characters and the twist at the end
It wasnt my favorite marvel movie, but the visual effects were pretty good. There were some slow parts. But, I have to say that this movie is better than than The Hulk.
It was a great introduction movie. Now that all the time was spent building new characters the next one should be better.
It was really good! And now Eternals is on my top 5.
One of the best terrible movies I have ever seen. It does not even begin to fit in the marvel cinematic universe. It is based on the work of jack kirby who famously left marvel to work at dc because he felt he did not get enough credit. So these were actually dc characters that marvel decided to shoehorn in to their mythos. Ugh it just does not work. Pretty movie though.
Even Mrs. Fields burns a cookie now and then. Marvel can’t always spin gold. An ambitious movie that came up short. A feature film was not the format to introduce the Eternals. A Disney plus series would have been perfect.To many characters to develop in a limited time frame. Hayek and Jolie’s acting talents were wasted here. They were there for name recognition only as they barely appeared on screen or acted much when they were. The movie had pacing problems throughout. The action scenes were filmed really dark so it was difficult to make out action sequences. The movie overall felt kinda greyed out to me. Like a DC movie. Not as vibrant as other Marvel films. The climax of the film was rather anticlimax. The movie was overall boring and predictable to me. Kumail and his valet were the stars of the movie. If not for them it probably would have been $12, 2 and half hour nap. The end credit scenes were good. I will say that. If you can wait for it to drop on Disney plus.
I loved every minute of it. Interesting, dramatic, different from other MCU films, epic. Very complicated characters with satisfying arcs. Visuals were amazing.
Slow and long. The best part was the DC references and Harry Styles. Wait for it to be free on Disney+ if you must watch it.
The movie had really good special effects and was entertaining, but it was confusing, switch from present to past. I think there were too many characters introduced in one film. Not the best Marvel entry.
Casting was great with a lot of interesting characters. Beautiful filming locations. Story was a bit tedious but eventually came together.
Favorite marvel movie
